"You will see a step change from us at Arcanum to support a key component of the BCG/WEF recommendations:

3) Digital Transformation Acceleration:

""Well before the crisis, many businesses were pursuing digital transformation programmes. But what was a discretionary, self-paced transformation has become an urgent priority.

To compete dynamically on the rate of learning, organizations will need to be reconceived to combine human ingenuity with machine learning. Companies must focus on the human side of digital transformation at least as much as the technological side.""

"This made for a good read this weekend morning. It always helps to pause and put things into perspective. 

 What truly drives you? Having been though a wave of shifts last year, this read made me pause and take stock. 

Personally, I have always been interested in solving puzzles. Finding a better method amidst chaos. This drove my third shift, from pure creative to a solver of business puzzles. This work funnily enough excites me. In the same way Peter in the article talked of the music exciting him, and Warren about investing success, not the money. 

In a way, if you do what you truly enjoy, success follows. 

Maybe this period, allows us each a pause to take stock of what we really love, and what we would like to experiment with. You don't need to shift immediately, but maybe spending a weekend building that additional loved space would be a good use of our time.
For me that shift means getting back into some programming, by learning Python and doing a course on machine learning.  
Also getting back into dancing, something left neglected in the midst of work life.  

At the end, I feel all that is truly valuable is time...

"Finally 97 hours of hard work bearing its fruit with the completion of IBM Data Science Professional Certification.
 
In this specialization, one gets to understand all the processes, methods, and common tools and technologies used in Data Science. This specialization provides appropriate knowledge of various Machine Learning models such as Regression, Classification, Recommender systems, etc.
It also teaches us about visualizing the data using different packages such as folium, pyplot, seaborn, and many more. Starting from basic understandings of data science and its processes, we also get to learn about Python and it's different packages, how to use IBM cloud services for data science, different notebooks such as Jupyter and zeppelin,
how to use databases and SQL with Python for analyzing the data and a lot more.

Coursera and IBM worked really well to provide comprehensive yet adequate knowledge for those developers who are looking forward
to working in the Data Science field.

"As we know machine learning plays very important role in medical science. At a time of solving some commercial , educational and many more types of problems using machine learning , we have to take care about bias variance tradeoff and performance of model. 
when we solve problem of medicine science , we also must take care about interpretability of model. 
Here is the question , what is interpretability and blackbox model.
A model which is classified disease with some particular reason of that disease is known as interpretable model.
Ex.. Doctor is using ML model for predicting patient has cancer or not ?. If model predict patient has a cancer due to their high acid concentration in blood.where acidity is feature of trained data. This is more helpful for medical science.  then 
hashtag
#machinelearning is get more trust from the 
hashtag
#medicalsciences . If we use blackbox model ,  if model predict cancer , doctors can't make sure about what is reason for it  . So this type of model leads some doubt for medical science.
If you are agree with me , please comment .

"When we are working with image datasets, it is usual that our images come from different sources, but not only that, probably  they were taken on different locations, with different illumination conditions and by different people. The light conditions play a fundamental role when classifying images, the heterogeneity of it can make difficult image classification tasks. One solution to this problem is Color Constancy, this paper is a good point to start with the fundamental concepts about it.

"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is more general than supervised learning or unsupervised learning. It learns from interaction with the environment to achieve a goal or simply learns from reward and punishments. In other words, algorithms learn to react to the environment. RL’s TD-learning seems to be closest to how humans learn in this type of situation, but Q-learning and others also have their own advantages.

"I had made an WebApp to summarise the document.
It is based on Node JS and Python.
Front-end of this WebApp is made using the ejs(embedded javascript template).
Server used is express server to route.
Back-end or you can say document processing works on python.
I had use two ways to summarise the document
i>> using my own python script based on nltk.
ii>> using the gensim_ext_sum library.

Document parsing is done using the pdfx.
While the file uploading and file management is done using multer.
If you choose to use my python script you need to install nltk, stopwords, and punkt.
While you are lazy like me you can use 2nd option which is quit easy, just by installing gensim_ext_sum.

Nowadays everyone is on the path of optimization of storage. If you are kind of who is on path of storage optimization you can use 2nd script. It requires much less storage space to execute.

The working of my project you can see on the link below on YouTube and don't forget to check out code on GitHub, suggestions are always welcome.

 - gain a practical understanding of Apache Spark, and apply it to solve machine learning problems involving both small and big data.
I think IBM courses are in general good and take you to the point I did learn a lot from this course still, it was not as practical as I was expecting.
I got my 4th badge at IBM and it feels good actually it gives kind of a push toward learning more and more.

"In this post, we’ll describe a way to easily automate exporting results from BigQuery to email.

Data accessibility and analysis is a crucial part of getting value from your data. While there are many methods to view data when it comes to BigQuery, one common way is to export query results as an email on a scheduled basis. This lets end users get an email with a link to the most recent query results, and is a good solution for anyone looking for daily statistics on business processes, monthly summaries of website metrics, or weekly business reviews. Whatever the query may be, stakeholders who need the information can access data easily via email for relevant insights.

"A highly impactful use of AI ML has been personalization in the digital world.

Most products have adopted this trend by personalizing micro-content. Product owners shouldn't shy away from thinking about high-impact personalization of a product which could deliver completely personalized applications starting from onboarding, navigation and engagement.
 
For example, the navigation of an app could evolve to completely drop those links from the navigation bar, which a user visits only 5% of the time and replacing it with those links, which the user visits often.
 
Lets take Netflix as example. I am more fond of TV series, instead of movies. However, my husband is a big fan of Avengers Movies (Surprise!). If the main navigation on my Netflix account showed me categories of the TV shows & gave a link to Superhero movies for my husband, we both will have a more delightful experience! And this can be taken to the next level as the usage pattern of each user is identified and as it evolves over a period of time. Such application would evolve as the user's needs evolve with time and would stay more relevant to the user
 
Apps which will harness the true power of AI ML to provide more convenient and delightful experience would win in the long run.

"The capstone project of my master's study has finally come to an end. For this project, I and my teammates want to explore people's 
hashtag
#mentalhealth. We use 
hashtag
#machinelearning to predict whether people seeking mental health treatment and group people and analyze their characteristics, use 
hashtag
#regression to find correlations, and finally to get some insights and suggestions to the human resources department.

After our analysis, we think companies should raise more awareness for providing access to mental health support to their employees and make them understand that both mental health and physical health are equally important. It is more likely that an employee stays healthy and becomes more productive if the company he or she works for cares about their mental wellbeing. It is very important to encourage employees to utilize and take advantage of existing mental health support programs.

"In this blog post, we’ll show you how to set up a streaming pipeline to natively push your Google Cloud data to your Splunk Cloud or Splunk Enterprise instance using the recently released Pub/Sub to Splunk Dataflow template. Using this Dataflow template, you can export data from Pub/Sub to Splunk. So, any message that can be delivered to a Pub/Sub topic can now be forwarded to Splunk. That includes logs from Cloud Logging (formerly Stackdriver Logging), messages from IoT devices, or events such as security findings from Cloud Security Command Center.

The step-by-step walkthrough covers the entire setup, from configuring the originating log sinks in Cloud Logging to the final Splunk destination—the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) endpoint.

"Regression models have been around for many years and have proven very useful in modeling real world problems and providing useful predictions, both in scientific and in industry and business environments. In parallel, neural networks and deep learning are growing in adoption, and are able to model complex problems and provide predictions that resemble the learning process of the human brain. What’s the connection between neural networks and regression problems? Can you use a neural network to run a regression? Is there any benefit to doing so?
The short answer is yes—because most regression models will not perfectly fit the data at hand. If you need a more complex model, applying a neural network to the problem can provide much more prediction power compared to a traditional regression!

"So glad to announce that our article has been published by Towards Data Science! 

Written by Xingxuan Zhang, Xinyue (Willa) Yu, Aijie Li and me, this article covers how we utilized 
hashtag
#machinelearning algorithms to retrieve multi-dimensional public sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic via a deep-dive analysis on tweets and news topics in this period. In this article, we:

·   Took an overall look at what happened on Twitter during the pandemic;
·   Extracted multi-dimensional sentiments and analyzed their trends;
·   Conducted topic analysis on news topics to aid our understanding of tweets.

We got this idea when participating in the UC Davis MSBA COVID-19 Challenge. Here we want to express our sincere thanks to MSBA leaders Amy Russell and Shachi Govil for providing this great opportunity, and we are grateful for the valuable suggestions from Prof. Ashwin Aravindakshan and Prof. Jörn Boehnke.

"Microsoft Azure Bootcamp 
AI-100T01- Designing and Implementing an Azure AI Solution

Thanks to UTP CIS Department for collaborating with Microsoft through Iverson, and Trainer Mr.Arun for giving me the opportunity to learn more on Cloud Computing in this virtual bootcamp.

In this bootcamp, I certainly learn a lot of interesting facts and knowledge regarding Azure Services and also how to develop a chat box from the services and how to create chat samples. This was a good 2 and a half day virtual learning experience as we are all moving towards online medium and towards digitalisation.

"A lot of data science prep materials tell you to know the assumptions of regression - fewer get you ready for a question I love to ask: what happens to the bias and variance of coefficients in OLS when the different assumptions are violated, and why?

1. This question goes beyond memorization. Assumptions are somewhat easy to recall - what happens if you violate them is more challenging.

2. It often brings in real world experience. This is a really good ""tell me about a time when..."" type of question for more experienced candidates engaged in a modeling discussion.

3. The question tells you a lot about the candidate's understanding of statistics and attention to assumptions. In my opinion, most data science programs are too light on stats.

4. It bridges to another great question: what business impact would this have if a model with inflated bias/variance made it to production? It does a solid job connecting the idea to the real world implications.

Have a good weekend!

🔉 Spoke on *TensorFlow Hub* for TensorFlow User Group Hyderabad. Deck is available here: http://bit.ly/tf-hub. A recording of the session is available here: https://lnkd.in/g-8itGe. 

👨🏾‍💻 Experimented with the ideas presented in the paper “Training BatchNorm and Only BatchNorm” by Frankle et al. and the results are really intriguing. Here’s the GitHub repo: https://lnkd.in/gMn_khv. 

👨🏾‍💻  Developed a minimal implementation of the seminal work on *SimCLR*  by Chen et al. Here’s the GitHub repo: https://lnkd.in/gRfkR3g. 

That’s all for today. Hopefully, by next week I will be able to come up with Weights and Biases reports on the experiments as mentioned in the third and fourth points. Have a great weekend y’all.

"Almost every ""Decision Making"" will be ""Data Driven"" in the near future. Data is the ""New King"" across the industries and across the boundaries - Retail, Healthcare, eCommerce, Engineering, Consumer Goods, Defence, Manufacturing, Construction, Real Estate etc. And, all this decision making is also continuously  supported by AI and Machine Learning. 

This is my first step to immerse myself in this vast, futuristic and  giant Domain of Data Analytics. I managed to learn and earn Certificates on Data Science Foundation,  Open Tools for Data Science and Data Science Methodology courses offered by IBM through Coursera under the Data Science Professional Certification. 

Currently I am learning about

"I am often asked - “how do I get my first job in machine learning?” My answer always has been - build a portfolio- through internships, Kaggle and personal projects.

This is a great thread on the perspective of a hiring manager on such portfolio projects - use messy data, focus on a applied problem statement, product oriented development and keep it to the point- I agree!

"A rota (rostering) tool from London-based tech company Rotageek that could help the NHS, has received £6m new investment. Rotageek uses cloud-based technology and automatic scheduling to help multi-site businesses manage and schedule staff to meet demand, drive efficiency and reduce costs. The tool uses machine learning to identify patterns which may otherwise go unnoticed and its apps make it easier for staff to swap and cover shifts and know when they are working. The service is currently being offered for free for the next three months to the NHS and wider healthcare teams impacted by the onset of COVID-19. The service will support decision-makers to deliver a fast, effective and coordinated response to substantial fluctuations in demand for hospital care presented by the pandemic.

Feature Extraction
To secure very critical information. It giving you a guarantee of your information.

Techniques used by feature extraction to preserve information.
- Convolution
It filters the important feature with the help of stride and it combines to make the different different feature.
It selects the relevant feature.
With the help of this, no. of pixel or feature would be minimized without losing any information.

"""Longformer is a BERT-like model for long documents."" -Allen AI
""Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer's attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention""

The idea with

#HerFreshStart scholarships is to enable mothers on a maternity break get back stronger into the workforce. A lot of mothers tend to drop out, and hence we have fewer women leaders. 

We're offering scholarships upto 80% on our online PG programs in Digital Marketing, AI & Machine Learning, Cloud Computing and Business Analytics with diplomas from University of Texas and Great Lakes, Chennai. This financial aid to upskill oneself is probably driving even more interest now because of the uncertain jobs scenario.
