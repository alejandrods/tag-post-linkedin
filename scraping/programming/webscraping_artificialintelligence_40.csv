"A lot of young and upcoming talent have lost jobs and internship opportunities because of the corona crisis. Instead of complaining or worrying about your bad luck you can choose to better yourself, learn new skill sets, and work hard enough that no crisis can make you irreplaceable. You can become indispensable with the right amount of hard work put consistently for a significant amount of time.

With mentorship from the tech wizards and entrepreneurs of the next generation, the amount of time for you to become indispensable can drop from 5 years to as short as 6 months. That's the power of mentorship.

Corona crisis not only affected employees and students but it also affected the startup founders and CEOs. They are looking for talent to help their companies survive and grow during this crisis but do not have enough funds to pay salaries.

This will be your opportunity to pitch to work for free and do remote internships for a period of 3 months, 6 months, even 1 year. Especially for those students who will graduate in a year or two. You are getting an opportunity to learn, grow, mentored by leaders of the future generation. The kind of opportunity that can make you indispensable. Take it.

"Hello again people, out with one of my experiments again and this time I tried out the Arbitrary Style Transfer.

We all know about style transfer (Gatys et al.) which learns from style and content images, minimizing the gram matrix loss and euclidean distance loss. Then came out fast style transfer, which leverages the power of transfer learning to make this process real time, but again we lose the power to do this for any style and content image.

To overcome all these limitations, N-style papers came out, that learned from the style and content images in parallel and then the BN layers weights were shared with the style transfer network. This overcame all the aforementioned limitations, all that was left was for the networks to learn absolute generalization.

In came the Arbitrary Style Transfer paper : https://lnkd.in/gXeUAGt , at the heart of their method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Any previous issues with performance are eliminated, all using a single feed-forward neural network.

Check out my implementation here : https://lnkd.in/gnDpiip

"Brilliant article (also available here: https://lnkd.in/gtP64C6), articulating views I completely identify with. 

TL/DR, and with apologies (you do need to read it): 

- labelling is unhelpful (not only everything as AI, but also arbitrarily creating subdivisions); 
- know about and respect what you are building on; 
- see beyond the tool to the application (e.g. IoT is fine as a start, but there's a lot more to making better decisions); 
- focus on creating (""engineering"") something useful, not the perfect end game of AGI."

while it will most probably determine development of ""third generation"" Artificial Intelligence

Intel Corporation, one of biggest players in developing neuromorphic computing explains

""the first generation of AI was rules-based and emulated classical logic to draw reasoned conclusions within a specific, narrowly defined problem domain.

the second, current generation is largely concerned with sensing and perception, such as using deep-learning networks to analyze the contents of a video frame.

a coming next generation will extend AI into areas that correspond to human cognition, such as interpretation and autonomous adaptation."" 

and significant breakthroughs are already on the way.

"During last spring semester, my team of 'Introduction to Artificial Intelligence' course, Bernadine Lye, Anita Chia and I worked on 'Mask R-CNN - Pedestrian Detection' project.

Autonomous vehicles need to identify human features accurately to ensure safe self-driving in real time. But as the types of scenarios of transportation are diversified, we are increasingly in need of more sophisticated human detection techniques. Therefore, my team reviewed the various computer vision technologies, and applied one of the state-of-art ‚ÄòInstance segmentation‚Äô deep learning techniques called 'Mask R-CNN' to the 'WiderPerson' dataset. 

Though some of the pedestrians are overlapped, partially visible, or not even stood upright, our model could still pick out those pedestrians and also pick out non-humans figures although the appearance was very similar to human. 

We had a great experience during last semester and would like to explore other computer vision techniques like 'YOLO' to solve our problem and compare them with our model to ultimately find the best model for our use case of autonomous vehicles & pedestrian detection.
Below are some of the screenshots from our final presentation!

"Competing for the title are 13 teams of musicians, artists, scientists and programmers from Australia, Sweden, Belgium, the U.K., France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. They all submitted pieces of music beforehand that were created with the help of artificial intelligence. (The organizers are not awarding any cash prizes in the inaugural competition.)

While the use of AI is what makes the event distinctive, organizers asked contestants to keep songs under three minutes and not to submit works totally created by AI. Rather, the works must feature some human element, either in the song‚Äôs composition or its performance. Teams were also required to submit written evidence detailing how they used AI in their compositions. Other than that, contestants had creative freedom to do whatever they, or an algorithm, wanted.

One team used AI to compose a bass line, which they then doubled at a couple of octaves plus a third to give them the melody. They then tapped AI to come up with the opening lyrics of the song, which are sung by synthesized voices. Another team let AI write the chords, the melody and the bass line, says Newton-Rex, who is a London-based composer and director of the AI lab at Chinese tech company ByteDance.

A thousand miles of technology is going to determine everyone's international community competitiveness in the future,that is beyond any doubt.
To begin with,we should know that the basic concepts of algorithms,coding software and bigdata that are three cores of AI,so both  machine learning & Deep learning are very important.hence if AI robots penetrate into more industry's fields will become AI plus.
Bigdata is not only to support the basis  of AI the mainly keypoint,but also make robots more humanized & more smarter.
Someone have ever said that "" AI is the best method to solute overwhelming screen problems "", what do you think of that ?

"My friend here developed an app which alerts you if you go 50 meters away from your home. If you have a mask, the alarm will stop else, you have to go back and get your mask. He developed this from his house and deployed the trained tf model into an android device using an app developed by his team mate. It makes us wonder if lockdowns actually have an effect on the amount of work that can be done by a person.

Hilarious.
"There is a lot of things that can happen with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Adding a virtual assistant who can talk with people in this modern life is one of them and this is why chatbots are here.
In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has helped a lot regarding these newly-built bots. They can be used in different ways such as being a friend, a selling assistant or even a doctor.
As my BS.c Dissertation, I developed one of these chatbots, using a framework named RASA NLP. In this presentation, I took a look at different types of chatbots and their history and I also explained how I have developed one of them with the help of Rasa NLP.

While these are the use cases that require sophisticated data sets & can't be just done with mere ML techniques and webscraping, we do have basic attributes of AI being explicitly used by our Cops to check violations during lockdown.

It's very promising to see Hyderabad Police using AI based system to identify people who violate face mask rule.This is first of it's kind initiative in the country using Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques on CCTVs.

Hopefully we would see more of these in India, especially for implemention of law & order.

"Why AI?
Education is the basis of all creative and progressive aspects of a society. It sharpens a child‚Äôs mind and helps her/him to think creatively. It helps her/him to differentiate between logical and emotional choices as well. These children grow up to be doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, scientists and what not. 
When your child gets the help of a human (both intellectual and emotional), as well as part human (highly intellectual) technology in her/his education, it undoubtedly helps tremendously.
Apart from tasks like text-to-speech, chatbots and automated grading, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also capable of detecting patterns of your child‚Äôs behaviour and performance. Technology today can help you and your child‚Äôs teachers and mentors understand the various factors affecting your child‚Äôs performance.
Don‚Äôt hesitate, your child is walking into a digital era, where soon human emotions might be imitated by bots and assistive devices.

"Delimiting

#AI to just some 'predictive analytics' or 'pattern recognition' is undermining its potential. The biggest use of AI is in 
hashtag
#design which until now was totally based on human learning, smartness, skills & experience. AI can design & redesign almost everything. It can design toxic to life-saving ( new drugs discovery with better precision to improve prognosis). It can design food ( with higher nutritional value, that tastes better, costs lesser & stays fresh for longer), It can design circular from linear ( design out waste & pollution with better material/product design & business models). It can design school dropouts to learners (design community-centric curricula & pedagogy). Usecases & applications are many. Prototyping and testing were costly and time-consuming when it was solely based on human skills & experience but with AI, rapid prototyping & testing is possible. It could correct design flaws in our existing products & business models. It could help in design-led innovation. @sanjay_abraham

"Any solution to a problem must exhibit three characteristics, i.e., doing the right thing, doing it right, and covering all the risks.

On the contrary, a solution that does not:
 - cover all the risks is mostly ""unreliable.""
 - do the thing right is mostly ""inefficient.""
 - do the right thing is mostly ""unwanted."" 

Recently launched contact tracing app received some backlash that I think was avoidable.

But then there are so many other technology solutions that fall short of some of these aspects regularly. 

I wonder if it is a matter of ignorance, incompetence, or ethics.

Thoughts?

The field of AI is larger than only Machine Learning and computional data science !
Technology and automation is not the goal for business; only a means.
There is something more valuable and profitable !
The key still remains - and will - in ""expert system modeling""... For example, Einstein's main discoveries can never be imagine based on data :  imaginative experts with ""thought experience"" is what the world really need first.

"Here is a paper I recently worked on for my seminar at my university. It compares the usage of Deep Residual networks in Image Recognition and Image Steganalysis and also talks about the drawbacks in Deep Convolutional Neural networks. I drew these conclusions based on two research papers:
1) Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition - K. He, X Zhang, S. Ren, J. Sun. (2016) 
2) Deep residual learning for image steganalysis - S. Wu, S. Zhong, Y. Liu (2017) 
Looking forward to your comments and suggestions :)

"AI/ML has it's application in every sector and is helping organizations across globe to increase the efficiency of operations by cutting cost. This is something which is must to do for capital intensive sector like Telecom. So the Telecom companies are betting high on these technologies. One of the interesting case of this technological use by telco is of Turk Telekom.
Turk Telekom deployed AI and ML on a big-data platform to identify anomalies and reduce potential customer-impacting problems on the network backbone leading to realization of reduction in RTT delays and increase in detection of anomalies in network.

"The shift to digital has been well under way for years in retail, but today, retailers have a new sense of urgency to digitally transform as the industry responds to COVID-19. The pandemic has dramatically impacted the retail industry at-large, exposing gaps in omnichannel capabilities, business continuity plans, and supply chain responsiveness. 

The pandemic has also had a polarizing effect on retailers. On one hand, grocery and mass merchandisers are experiencing unprecedented surges, while retailers in other categories, like fashion and beauty, are experiencing declines in many product categories. As we look to the future, we know that recovery will take time and will vary by sub-segment. 

To help retailers tackle these challenges, we‚Äôre sharing a number of industry-tailored solutions to support our customers and partners during this time.

"According to Google News Initiative, it is important for journalists to embrace technology, and gain some expertise to use different 
hashtag
#AI products. 

So, recently a 
hashtag
#machinelearning course was included under Google News Initiative for media organisations.  Google says AI/Ml can promote the efforts of journalists who are disseminating critical information to their readers.

A journalist can leverage machine learning in-depth analysis and investigations, which can then be taken forward for better engagement. Learning basic 
hashtag
#artificialintelligence tools becomes an important consideration given redundant reporting processes are being automated across 
hashtag
#media organisations.

So, not just to prepare themselves against future job automation, AI/ML holds tremendous value in things like fact-checking and deriving insights from various data resources.

The democratisation of AI/ML and algorithms will deeply impact journalism. Whether it is text, video, audio or others, information can be numerically represented for getting deep insights.

"I am really not surprised at the amount of importance and focus that ""AI"" is getting these days.

This was the book that introduced me to Neural Networks way back in 1997. 

In 1998, I wrote my first ever ""AI based"" program in C++ that simulated a changing eco-system and behaviours of dependent ""digital protozoa"". It was something special given the fact that it had elements of NN and Fuzzy logic driving it.  

It gave me a taste of the power of AI and its possibilities. 

I dropped the subject soon after as it was not ""practical"" then, and eventually subjected myself to concrete logic. NN was out of my life, but Fuzzy Logic stayed on and I have used it quite frequently since then. 

 I am very positive on ""AI"" - are you too?

"The weekend went well! This was yet another course on the tougher side. RNN, GRU, and LSTM are concepts I've tried to understand before through various online resources but I think this course had the best explanation for each of them. Although, this view might be biased because of the fact that this time around, I already a very good foundation ready to help me understand these sequence models. I thoroughly enjoyed the machine translation and speech recognition case studies. And let's not forget Word2Vec embeddings, a popular ntlk feature many of us would have used for various types of textual analysis without actually having any intuition on how these embeddings might have been derived. All in all, even this was fun!
