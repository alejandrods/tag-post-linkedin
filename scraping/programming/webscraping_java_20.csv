"While not exactly the most visually impressive, I’m very proud of this project. There were many firsts for me in this school assignment. The goal was to create a web application using Java Servlets and JSP that allowed the user to add and view information from an Oracle database. This is the first web application I’ve created completely from scratch, database to UI. It’s the first time I’ve worked with Servlets and JSP. The first time I’ve sent and received data from a database. I’ve learned so much from this project. Seeing the entire process front to back has connected many dots that have previously been a mystery. I’m excited to take this new knowledge and put it to use creating even more technically impressive applications. While a small victory, I feel very accomplished. 🙌🏻

"Hello Folks,

Hope you are doing well.

Being an Android developer, I know that technologies are changing very rapidly now a days. After Android SDK, Flutter provides a strong and better environment for us to create amazing apps. I have started learning Flutter few months ago by myself.

Few of my friends/colleague approached me as they find a lot of trouble to understand the concepts of Flutter SDK from Basic to advance level.

Instead of helping them individually I have created an application that will help everyone to understand all of Flutter features easily.

This application have all the required information in detail which you would need while working on Flutter environment.

I am open to any suggestion that can make this application more valuable to you all.
