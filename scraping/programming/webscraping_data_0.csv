"No doubt Excel quite powerfull tools. It is also 'Cross-Platform' across  different roles in organization. 

Lets try out some Machine Learning Technique in Excel to develope a better understanding behind Machine Learning Algorithm / Statistical Calculation.

Excel can execute linear regression, ETS Forecast, ARIMA Forecast, even can transfer the working calculation behind Prophet Forecast to do it in excel. What's more ? Simple Machine Learning technique such as Decision Tree , Bayes and  kNN works like charms too.

and I do not try this yet - BERT toolkit ( https://bert-toolkit.com/) enable Excel wizard to load R Library and function to use it within Excel function. wow ! imagine I can test out some R algorithm in excel before completely build reproducible data product in R. ~ different datasets needs different treatment ~. The purpose of this to see how well the model fits into Business Operation / Domain.

Business Domain Knowledge must come first before any statistical technique.

If you got large datasets  - you can load to Excel Power Query / connect to your database / ETL tools. 

Dont forget about VBA, m code and DAX in excel too !

what's in it for you with Excel ?
