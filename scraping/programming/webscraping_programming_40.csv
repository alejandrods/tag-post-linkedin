"‚ÄúAnnouncing Adobe XD support for Flutter‚Äù by Tim Sneath

We've always dreamt of tools that'd make the development procedures much more easier and fun to work through, finally Adobe XD announced a tool that'll convert some of your XD design to an actual Flutter and dart code!

Of course you can't depend on it to do all the work for you, for instance it doesn't support responsive layouts (as of now), so you might have to work on the layouts after it's generated.

"Learning a new language is fun. But developing a whole new language is challenging as well as exciting. As a part of my coursework, I have developed this new language Decaf20. It is more similar and simpler version of C, developed in python. The library I have used is PLY.lexer, only for the lexical analysis part. Further work can be done on code optimization, especially for the machine code generation part. I am really happy to share this!

"Getting stuck on an error is not as bad as you'd think. You get to learn a lot more trying to solve the error than just letting someone else solve it or panicking over it. 

The other day I spent almost 8 hours solving a git push error that occurred due to a new large file in my codebase. 

The error had a wonderful, unexpected outcome: my first technical blog post!

This blog post is here to help some developer out there not spend 8 hours trying to fix the same error. 

Hope it helps someone out there!

#python. It taught me to work with lists, dictionaries and strings in python. Lastly , as my final project I built a word cloud in python using all the concepts I learnt. The practice quizzes were challenging and the way the instructors explained was very easy to comprehend. I was a beginner who did not even have the basic idea of python syntax and I ended up feeling confident about the basics of python. This course got me interested in programming and I hope to develop my skills further."

"I was drawn to programming because I wanted to do something where I could ""make stuff"".  One of my first projects was a memory match game.

With input from a friend, I created a word association game that he could use when he works with kids with special needs.  He just messaged me that the assistant director of his region shared it with her supervisors.  

That was an awesome message to receive, and was only made possible because of the great instructors at LearningFuze!

"Here I successfully completed Certificate of Completion for the amazing ""Software Engineering Virtual Experience"" from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and InsideSherpa.
The concept of elucidating the aspects of software development and its tools, namely; Python, Git, React, TypeScript, Web Applications, Technical Communication, Financial Analysis and Data Visualization was phenomenal and worth effort. It involves the JPMorgan Chase framework

"Here is a data definition for measuring time:
(define-struct time (hours minutes))
; A Time is a (make-time Hour Minute)
; interpretation: (make-time h m) is the time  
; expressed in h hours and m minutes
; 
; ‚Äì An Hour is a NaturalNumber between 0 and 11
; ‚Äì A Minute is a NaturalNumber between 0 and 59
Design the function tock, which adds one minute to the given time.

Design the function time->text, which converts a time to a text. The text should look like the display of a common alarm clock, i.e., it should separate the minutes from the hours with a colon. Hint: a text is an image, not a string, but you will need a string version of the time, too. See the HelpDesk for more on the text function.

After you have developed these functions, add a main function, which launches a big-bang program to animate the time.

"Social Distancing Analyser
==================

According to WHO, at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between persons are must to reduce the spread of corona virus (COVID-19). To analyse Social distancing in a public places and carry out necessary actions to better deal with the pandemic, I developed a model which can analyse social distancing parameters by detecting distance between two persons.

This is just a demo applied on a small video, I got to learn a lot with this project. Hope you will like it.

"Looking to learn Nodejs?

How about starting by learning the following 5 things?

1. The Javascript standard ECMAScript: learning this will help you understand what JS features are supported in your Nodejs version and what is not. 
2. The languages in which you can write Nodejs applications. Namely Javascript or Typescript.
3. The Observer pattern, as Nodejs applications heavily rely on this design pattern.
4. The Callback pattern which supplements the Observer pattern in carrying out executions.
5. Basics of the V8 engine and how it executes the Javascript code that you write. It's important not to go too deep into this has it can be quite complex to understand at first.

Before we analyse the data the main thing that we must do is
Extract the data.
In some cases the data might be available in a readable form, but there are some cases where you need to extract it.
Today, I was trying to use tweepy to extract data, as I wanted to analyse the archive of a popular account.
To gather this data I defined the file - url, request this url and write the content of the response to a separate file.
I will update the analysis once I'm done

"Sorry for bursting your bubble guys but your solution isn‚Äôt always optimized as it seems on leetcode runtime distribution.
Or vice-versa.

I submitted my solution, mine solution runtime was showing 256ms and the most optimized one was 196ms.
So I thought of comparing both on my machine.

Guess what? Mine is faster. I tried many times, there is always a large difference in the result.

I guess distribution differs because of submission at different points of time. It runs on different machines at different points of time (runtime varies machine to machine).

So CHILL don‚Äôt bother about the runtime. :p
