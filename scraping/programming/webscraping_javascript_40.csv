"So last Friday was an end to my awesome experience at Cvent. It is said that the first job's experience, learning, and connections are incomparable and I am glad to have Cvent as that stepping stone for me.

A year ago, when I stepped into the Cvent's office, I never thought I'll end up with all the great opportunities, experiences, friendships, amazing colleagues, and growth that I have undergone here!

From debugging issues that occurred in some of the biggest events worldwide to training and preparing the new generation of interns, all the way through while spending time working on developing Cvent's internal Node.js and Angular.js projects. Discovering my ability to handle high pressure by hopping onto onsite issues and providing creative resolutions on a high priority basis and also developing javascript codes to handle high dollar value client's issues. I was awarded, inspired, humbled, and continued to feel immense gratitude for the path I've had the opportunity to tread. 

It was great to participate in Cvent's Annual Hackathon and compete with the greatest minds of Tech globally. Exhilaratingly, our team was awarded the first position.

For all the typescript Devs, it is supported out of the box, no need to download extra packages and linters. 

It’s something to look into as who might know, it may actually become an industry standard one day taking the position where node is right now.

"Looking to learn Nodejs?

How about starting by learning the following 5 things?

1. The Javascript standard ECMAScript: learning this will help you understand what JS features are supported in your Nodejs version and what is not. 
2. The languages in which you can write Nodejs applications. Namely Javascript or Typescript.
3. The Observer pattern, as Nodejs applications heavily rely on this design pattern.
4. The Callback pattern which supplements the Observer pattern in carrying out executions.
5. Basics of the V8 engine and how it executes the Javascript code that you write. It's important not to go too deep into this has it can be quite complex to understand at first.

"What is the concurrent mode in react?


React is continuously adding new powerful features to its core API’s and speedily adapting to a better way of programming. Last time the react team came up with the hooks which are a cool and smart feature for functional programming. Now its time for introducing concurrency in react!
So what is concurrency at all?
If you start searching in google you can see thousands of examples and definitions for concurrency in computer-science, many of them play around with the classical dining philosopher problem. But in our case react is going to solve a very simple problem that modern JavaScript libraries haven’t addressed yet.
The non-blocking rendering
Typically the modern UI libraries do not support interrupting the rendering process. This is called the blocking rendering, now react is going to make it non-blocking. That is the rendering is Interruptible.

Guys check this out!!
"I NEVER EVER wanted to learn to write code or program.

I was scared and afraid and didn't see the value or use.  

It was like walking into AP Calculus class junior year.

Why do I even need math?  When will I ever use this?

Eventually I saw dollar signs and green pastures.

So, I would go to Barnes & Noble and read books about coding.
hashtag
#Java, 
hashtag
#HTML, 
hashtag
#Python, 
hashtag
#C#, 
hashtag
#PHP, 
hashtag
#JavaScript.

I kept my determination, practiced, and eventually it was easy to code.

"Closures in Javascript are possible because of two things:

1. Functions are first-class citizens. We can pass functions around like data — like any other type in Javascript.

2. Lexical scope: Based on where our code is written, the Javascript engine knows before we even run the code what variables each function has access to.

And that's what a closure is — a combination of a function and the lexical environment from which it was declared.

Closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or environment even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.

They have two main benefits:
  1. They can be very memory efficient.
  2. They allow us to do Encapsulation.

This is internship gives the basic idea of how data visualization is achieved by JP Morgan using their unique open source tool called ""Perspective"". All the internship is divided is different tasks and fun to do step by step. More over the the best part is that it give the complete idea to a beginner who don't know how to setup the dev environment for react applications. And while setting up the app we face a lot of errors regarding the versions of packages and modules used.I have learnt a lot while fixing them.

#Serverless chat app practice. As I'm learning more about about serverless technologies I admit was completely unaware of the power/potential of ApiGateway, it does a lot of heavy lifting. The best example of this i've seen (so far) has been with the creation of 
hashtag
#websocket 
hashtag
#api which simply facilitate real time connections & messages back and forth between connected users. I came across an implementation written in 
hashtag
#javascript and wanted to gain more familiarity, so I put this one together in 
hashtag
#python. Without going too much into the weeds, the lambda functions are triggered when a client connects to the websocket, api gateway provides a connection id for the session, which is stored in 
hashtag
#dynamodb. Once connected, a user enters a text message using the correct syntax, and this message is pushed to all connected clients in real time, because the connection ids are stored and fetched from the database (I think that's so clever). API gateway manages the connections and triggers lambda functions which facilitates the sending of messages between all connected users...just a basic chat application. Thanks

"Finally completed Full Stack MERN Bootcamp from learncodeonline.in 
Although It's a long course, but there is a lot to learn from it. Personally I have learned several things other than the MERN Stack, while going through this course. Along with learning Nodejs, Reactjs, I have explored some other frameworks of Javascript such as Electron and planning to give a try to build Desktop application using Electron. I have explored Materialize CSS and sometimes had to look into some Javascript foundation videos also for

It was not so easy to complete this 52.5 hours of course within 3 weeks. Had a tough time by sacrificing my few hours of sleep each day.
The way the instructor taught all the topics was really good. It could be understood by anyone.
Only thing what we need is pure dedication, commitment and most importantly love for this awesome programming language.
Thank you Maximilian Schwarzmüller Academind GmbH for offering such a good course.

These days, there is so much clutter in linkedin, which you might not want to see it (like jobloss stories, hiring clickbaits, etc), I have created a chrome extension to filter such clutter.
Simply , add a word, and filter out posts with such words.
