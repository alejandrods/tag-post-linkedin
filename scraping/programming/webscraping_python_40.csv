#framework that offers commonly used functionality for development of Extract-Transform-Load 
hashtag
#ETL processes. pygrametl is maintained by our colleagues Christian Thomsen and Søren Kejser Jensen. 
pygrametl has had a successful reach in the industry. A recent experience (https://lnkd.in/gav2Y6E) was shared by Catalyst IT (https://catalyst-au.net), a global team of open source experts that specialise in developing, designing, and supporting enterprise-grade open source solutions. 

The main strengths of pygrametl mentioned by Catalyst IT were:
1. Lots of good code examples in the documentation.
2. Clever implementation of Dimension and Fact Table inserts and updates. Migration of legacy logic and data warehouse table structure with minimal changes.
3. The framework is built on the power of python, meaning any bespoke scripting transformations are easy even for a novice python developer.
4. Easy to run on pretty much any Linux environment.

"Getting Started with NumPy:

Before you jump into data science or machine learning, it is good to have some knowledge and basic skills on certain things. When I started to explore data science, one of my lecturers told me to learn the most used packages for data science namely NumPy, Pandas, etc. So, I took an online course from Edx which really helped me to grow my skills in those packages.

Today I will share a notebook that contains the fundamentals and some tips and tricks of NumPy. This will motivate you to learn more in the data science domain. This is totally for beginners who have just started to explore data science.

These following topics are covered in this notebook:

- Rank-1 Array.
- Rank-2 Array.
- 2x2 array of zeros
- 2x2 matrix with the diagonal 1s and the others 0
- Slice Indexing
- Boolean Indexing
- Array Operations (Arithmetic, Statistical, Sorting)
- Broadcasting
- Speed Test
- Dot Operations and many more.

I hope you all will like it. Enough of talking let's jump into the notebook. Happy Hacking.

First I preprocess and visualize data by Python. 
Then, analyze and transfer on Streamlit.
And finally, deploy this project on online dashboard by Heroku.

Thank you so much to my mentor for fruitful advise and useful documents.

"Feeling grand about spending my time on two of the most productive and sophisticated areas:

- Adobe Illustrator
- Python

The Illustrator CC MasterClass course has excellent content, well explained and has me feeling confident with the software at the end. Every word uttered is part of the lesson. With that level of focus, it's very easy to follow, learn and remember.

And The Automate the Boring Stuff with Python course was written for people who want to get up to speed writing small programs that do practical tasks as soon as possible. It's also best for beginners to start learning Python language I guess. By the end of this course, you'll be able to write code that not only dramatically increases your productivity, but also be able to list this fun and creative skill on your resume.

"A few months ago, I had gone through a paper on Neural Networks in Structural Health Monitoring and was intrigued by the application of Machine Learning in Structural Analysis and Optimisation. I started digging online for materials that could refine my knowledge and cater to my curiosity on the subject. 

Last Month, I discovered this course  'Introduction to Machine Learning' on Coursera. In addition to providing a Comprehensive Understanding of machine learning models (logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks and natural language processing), it furnsihed hands-on experience implementing the data science models on data sets by implementing machine learning algorithms with PyTorch and open source libraries.

"Hello Everybody,
I hope everyone's doing fine! 
I recently built a Telegram bot that provides you statistics on the COVID-19 Count. It generates a report, based on the country of your choice. The search currently supports almost all countries in the world. It also supports a state-wise selection for the countries of the USA, China, Italy, and Australia. The generated report contains statistics and graphical representations that provide a quick analysis of COVID-19 status of your state/country. The data is updated every day from the John Hopkins COVID-19 repository.

Any inputs on this would be highly valued.

You can also view and use the bot at @corona_count_bot on Telegram.

The bot is titled Corona Count.

"Just finished this pretty good course.
I've learned a few surprising things like Flask respond faster than ASP.NET CORE even though Python is interpreted(mostly) and there's no switch case implementation in Python.
Still, I prefer brackets over four white spaces for defining the beginning and the ending of a block of code ;-)

Here's the third episode of ""Digital Geoscience Data Handling using Python"" series.

Now it's about parsing the EDI Magnetotellurics data format without some dedicated package. Because of how short it was, I added a little processing and inversion using Genetic Algorithm as a twist!

Any feedback is welcome. Especially by the MT gurus around the world.
See you in the next one and stay strong.

"Finding the dog cookie in the image.
I am testing the ORB, short for Oriented Fast, and Rotated Brief algorithm… I don’t think I’ll be able to remember the long name. The algorithm finds key points in an object (training image) that usually fall within boundary/edge regions, where there are strong gradients/changes in the image. Later with the help of a matching function, similar key-point matches are found in the target image.

#jenkins. And each task in Jenkins is known as 
hashtag
#jobs.
 
Following are the Jobs involved in Task2:-
*Create and Launch Dockerfile for installing jenkins and hence set up.
JOB 1:-
Pull the GitHub repo automatically when developers push the repo to GitHub.

JOB 2:-
By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter install image container to deploy code ( eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).

JOB 3:-
Test your webpage if it is working or not.

JOB 4:-
If the webpage is not working, then send an email to the developer with error messages.

JOB 5:-
If the container where the app is running fails due to any reason then this job should automatically start the container again.

"Reliable data is crucial for Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Engineers. If you want to analyze a company, the first step is to find the data from different sources. Now you don't know how reliable and genuine the data is. Even if it is uploaded on Kaggle, it is still uploaded by some XYZ user.

For example, recently I was trying to analyze the worldwide data of coronavirus and I found out that many of the sources were not reliable.

One of the solutions to this problem is Web Scraping. Instead of relying on some random data, you can simply generate your own data from the official websites and that's the primary reason I took this course ""Web Scraping Using Python""

The second reason is the lack of data. We might be familiar with how easy it is to access open-source databases from international companies such as Amazon and Apple. But what if you want to analyze a local company and there is no data available? That's where Web Scraping comes in!

Note: I have found a few glitches in the course, if anyone wishes to learn Web Scrapping from scratch can DM me!

Thank You!
