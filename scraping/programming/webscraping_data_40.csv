#A great lesson to learn from one of the worlds best companies , General Electric for mid sized firms are :

1- In planning the"" middle ""is gone. We only have to define 2 points : where we plan to be 10 to 25  
hashtag
#years from now , and what we have to do in next 90 days . The 90 days point requires real time data and an executive team that can face the brutal reality of what the  
hashtag
#data is saying and then act accordingly . We don't need to fall or rise in love with our own 1-3 year plans.
2- Keep everything stupidly simple . If our strategies , plans , decisions ,

3- The best data is First Hand Data . This helps us to find out what's going in reality . 
4- We don't have a true

  A- Does our strategy matter to our existing and potential customers .

  B- Does our strategy differentiates us from competition

"Airflow ~ Datadog Integration:


The Airflow ~ Datadog Integration is the answer to  automate the monitoring of 
hashtag
#AirflowDAG failures by collecting useful metrics in Datadog and create Datadog Monitors across various platforms (ex: 
hashtag
#AWSEKS).

The 
hashtag
#DatadogAgent collects many metrics from Airflow, including those for:
 
hashtag
#DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs): Number of DAG    processes, DAG bag size, etc.
hashtag
#Tasks: Task failures, successes, killed, etc.
hashtag
#Pools: Open slots, used slots, etc.
hashtag
#Executors: Open slots, queued tasks, running tasks, etc.

Metrics are collected through the Airflow 
hashtag
#StatsD plugin and sent to Datadog‚Äôs DogStatsD.In addition to metrics, the Datadog Agent also sends service checks related to Airflow‚Äôs health.

A general overview of the 
hashtag
#dashboard created for  monitoring can be found in the attached screenshot.

"Knowledge or mere being aware has blurred the lines between a good and average leadership. 
This diagram depicts  differences  between Tacit Knowledge and Explicit Knowledge but also  between two kinds of Tacit Knowledge: Know Why and Know How. Tacit Know Why deals with values, feelings, motives, relationships and significance. Tacit Know How deals with intuitive interaction, habit, muscle-memory and competence. By contrast, Explicit Know What deals with facts, categories, models and metrics. Some might prefer to differentiate facts and metrics from categories and models. A problem arises when we conflate any of these three (or four) ways of knowing, imposing either 1. values, 2. skills, 3. data, or 4. categories as an exclusive or dominating epistemology. Why would we do this? It seems that psychological temperament,  social conditioning, educational experience and existential choice each play a role in deciding which of these ways of knowing we trust the most and assume to be regulative of the others. Even here there are those who will tend to pick only one or two of these four factors as the regulative and decisive ones, ignoring or minimizing the other factors that ‚Äújust don‚Äôt agree with them‚Äù

"I get uneasy whenever I am returning something...from Amazon or any other retailer.

Because I see that reverse logistics (since it does not add to the revenue) is extremely neglected from an operational efficiency aspect.

So as someone passionate about operational efficiency, I rant everytime I am returning something üòë

So here is my latest rant about reverse logistics...and of course with some suggestions on how we can leverage analytics to solve for the problem.

The solution suggested in this video is parcel network backhaul optimization.

Extremely challenging but not impossible...for someone with Amazon's data infrastructure...since nearly real time visibility, immaculately maintained packaging and delivery asset volume data, and a high level of accuracy of many other types of data that will be leveraged, is the key to solve it.

Organizations currently have a multitude of other problems to solve for but few years from now, they should look into reverse logistics. It is attractive not only from $$$ aspect but sustainability angel is also very important.

Side note: If you are thinking why I got the weird haircut I am sporting in this video...it is a result of trying to cut my hair myself. üòÅ

"Anyone can attain, provide, and relay a form of information. üìñ 

However, if you're unable or unwilling to connect the information, hold discussions, apply it, form an opinion, or question it...what's the point? Will your learning be truly authentic? How will it impact your mental growth? üßê

You could have a good memory or be skilled in test-taking... but just because you may retain information well does it really make you intelligent? ü§ì‚ùå

Knowledge is acquired based on facts, information, and skills through an individual's experience or practical and theoretical understanding of a subject matter. üß† 

Knowledge is an ever-evolving construct and you can gain knowledge if you choose to have an open mind, a willingness to listen, and ask questions. ü§î

hashtag
#Everyone has issues with 
hashtag
#data. 

The biggest challenges are 
hashtag
#operational.
hashtag
#Slow. Analytics teams often struggle to keep up with the business. They have to corral data, cleanse it, organize it...and that's before they even get to the computational bits. Their answers are often delivered weeks or months later -- too late for anyone to use them effectively.
hashtag
#Expensive. Talent is costly. This grates on executives who are already frustrated by how long it takes to get answers. It may not be fair, but it's 
hashtag
#reality.
hashtag
#Isolated. Analysts often don't have marketing or business knowledge, so they don't know what to focus on or how to explain the results to non-analysts.

"As I was writing my 
hashtag
#newbook on 
hashtag
#datastorytelling, I had an interesting epiphany‚Äîdata storytellers are change agents. Whenever we discover a new insight, the natural consequence of that insight is change. Stop doing that, and do more of this. Focus less on them, and concentrate more on these people. Spend less there, and invest more over here.

In our excitement to share our insights, we forget we're inviting change. There will always be resistance to change‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs for the better. Author Dan Millman said, ‚ÄúThe secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.‚Äù Rather than trying to destroy the pre-existing narrative in our audience‚Äôs minds that may be based on outdated, incomplete, or erroneous data, we need to build a new narrative with our new insights. If you‚Äôve read my book already, you know I place a lot of emphasis on driving action with insights. Data storytellers need to anticipate the resistance their insights will encounter. If we can craft our data stories more effectively, we can help mitigate and overcome this resistance to change.

"üî¶ With the vast majority of companies employing nowadays a work from home policy, people have switched to cloud apps in greater numbers. That includes Office 365 apps, which also happen to be greatly sought after hackers. 

üî¶ Such credentials are of use to bad actors looking to compromise systems and networks via remote desktop protocol (RDP) vectors or other methods. Since people tend to reuse credentials on multiple services, having access directly to stolen Office 365 credentials are very useful. 

üî¶ No wonder RDP brute force attacks have gone up by more than 30% in the past couple of months.

Lets try out some Machine Learning Technique in Excel to develope a better understanding behind Machine Learning Algorithm / Statistical Calculation.

Excel can execute linear regression, ETS Forecast, ARIMA Forecast, even can transfer the working calculation behind Prophet Forecast to do it in excel. What's more ? Simple Machine Learning technique such as Decision Tree , Bayes and  kNN works like charms too.

and I do not try this yet - BERT toolkit ( https://bert-toolkit.com/) enable Excel wizard to load R Library and function to use it within Excel function. wow ! imagine I can test out some R algorithm in excel before completely build reproducible data product in R. ~ different datasets needs different treatment ~. The purpose of this to see how well the model fits into Business Operation / Domain.

Business Domain Knowledge must come first before any statistical technique.

If you got large datasets  - you can load to Excel Power Query / connect to your database / ETL tools. 

Dont forget about VBA, m code and DAX in excel too !

what's in it for you with Excel ?

I have been utilizing this time to upgrade my skills through various online courses.

Considering the severity of the situation across the globe, I understand it is not going to be an easy road ahead, but I would like to use this platform and reach out to the LinkedIn community for support and assistance. I am currently looking for a summer internship in Data/ Business Analyst roles.

"I'm very excited that the Metrics feature in Tableau has finally shipped, but I'm more excited to be able to use it on a daily basis!

Every morning one of the first things I do is get a quick read on all my business metrics & KPIs. Within a few short seconds of picking up my phone, I know what's going on and what needs attention. Tableau Metrics was designed from the beginning to be the perfect tool for keeping an eye on your data any time and anywhere. https://lnkd.in/g9KHnpb

Today I was working on a Bike share dataset.
I tried to clean and analyze the dataset.
Some of the questions I took to analyze are:
1. In which areas are the business established. 
2. Which time the usage of the service is more? 
3. What type of users are using the service. 
4. In which days the demands is high? 

Will continue to analyze the dataset and share the results here.

My previous partners moved on to become CDs at a pro sports league, a major tech company, and some solid creative shops.

Me, I'm still tooling around Orange County and available for projects. I even picked up a new skill today after dropping my laptop: I can somewhat successfully use the right shift key.

a new part for my laptop is on its way. i hope the same holds true for work.

I feel sorry for the graduates, and I have no fake advice to give. The market is worse than 9/11 and more than likely, you have no experience. 

But stick with it. Hope for the best and prep for the worse. If it's prolonged, realize that last in first out is real and don't get happy on your first salary and buy things. Save instead. 

Be flexible. If you have LinkedIn premium, you'll see a lot of post with 400+ applicants. Hold out for your dream job if you want, just realize that the life cycle to landing your first job is longer.

When the PM spoke on progressively easing the lockdown on Sunday evening, the clear message was that data will help guide us out of this crisis. 

Gathering, structuring, analysis and presenting data as clear insights has never been as mission critical. The team at Elixirr have been producing a daily insight and analysis dashboard which cuts through the noise and provides an objective view of the situation. 

If you‚Äôre a business leader or simply interested in understanding the spread and control of C-19, I highly suspect this will be right up your street. Let us know what you think!

"In February 2020, Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council were hit by ransomware attacks that caused some of their officials to resort to pen and paper in place of digital to keep services running.
 
When a data breach makes the news, businesses often learn new security lessons and are encouraged to reassess their own processes, policies and protection levels. 

It is important now more than ever to have sufficient security management and applications in place as businesses have more employees working from home. 

Ensure your security plans protect your business as best you can and you have measures in place to detect live threats and mitigate against them. Speak to our account team if you're looking to review your security strategy.
