"You will see a step change from us at Arcanum to support a key component of the BCG/WEF recommendations:

3) Digital Transformation Acceleration:

""Well before the crisis, many businesses were pursuing digital transformation programmes. But what was a discretionary, self-paced transformation has become an urgent priority.

To compete dynamically on the rate of learning, organizations will need to be reconceived to combine human ingenuity with machine learning. Companies must focus on the human side of digital transformation at least as much as the technological side.""

"A lot of data science prep materials tell you to know the assumptions of regression - fewer get you ready for a question I love to ask: what happens to the bias and variance of coefficients in OLS when the different assumptions are violated, and why?

1. This question goes beyond memorization. Assumptions are somewhat easy to recall - what happens if you violate them is more challenging.

2. It often brings in real world experience. This is a really good ""tell me about a time when..."" type of question for more experienced candidates engaged in a modeling discussion.

3. The question tells you a lot about the candidate's understanding of statistics and attention to assumptions. In my opinion, most data science programs are too light on stats.

4. It bridges to another great question: what business impact would this have if a model with inflated bias/variance made it to production? It does a solid job connecting the idea to the real world implications.

Have a good weekend!

"A highly impactful use of AI ML has been personalization in the digital world.

Most products have adopted this trend by personalizing micro-content. Product owners shouldn't shy away from thinking about high-impact personalization of a product which could deliver completely personalized applications starting from onboarding, navigation and engagement.
 
For example, the navigation of an app could evolve to completely drop those links from the navigation bar, which a user visits only 5% of the time and replacing it with those links, which the user visits often.
 
Lets take Netflix as example. I am more fond of TV series, instead of movies. However, my husband is a big fan of Avengers Movies (Surprise!). If the main navigation on my Netflix account showed me categories of the TV shows & gave a link to Superhero movies for my husband, we both will have a more delightful experience! And this can be taken to the next level as the usage pattern of each user is identified and as it evolves over a period of time. Such application would evolve as the user's needs evolve with time and would stay more relevant to the user
 
Apps which will harness the true power of AI ML to provide more convenient and delightful experience would win in the long run.

"This made for a good read this weekend morning. It always helps to pause and put things into perspective. 

 What truly drives you? Having been though a wave of shifts last year, this read made me pause and take stock. 

Personally, I have always been interested in solving puzzles. Finding a better method amidst chaos. This drove my third shift, from pure creative to a solver of business puzzles. This work funnily enough excites me. In the same way Peter in the article talked of the music exciting him, and Warren about investing success, not the money. 

In a way, if you do what you truly enjoy, success follows. 

Maybe this period, allows us each a pause to take stock of what we really love, and what we would like to experiment with. You don't need to shift immediately, but maybe spending a weekend building that additional loved space would be a good use of our time.
For me that shift means getting back into some programming, by learning Python and doing a course on machine learning.  
Also getting back into dancing, something left neglected in the midst of work life.  

At the end, I feel all that is truly valuable is time...

"Finally 97 hours of hard work bearing its fruit with the completion of IBM Data Science Professional Certification.
 
In this specialization, one gets to understand all the processes, methods, and common tools and technologies used in Data Science. This specialization provides appropriate knowledge of various Machine Learning models such as Regression, Classification, Recommender systems, etc.
It also teaches us about visualizing the data using different packages such as folium, pyplot, seaborn, and many more. Starting from basic understandings of data science and its processes, we also get to learn about Python and it's different packages, how to use IBM cloud services for data science, different notebooks such as Jupyter and zeppelin,
how to use databases and SQL with Python for analyzing the data and a lot more.

Coursera and IBM worked really well to provide comprehensive yet adequate knowledge for those developers who are looking forward

#covid19 puts implementation pressure on organizations’ strategic digitalization policy faster than expected, more forcefully in companies in the developing countries. 

Employers are more than ever relying largely on machines that are not limited by threats to health as viable substitute for humans to sustain and drive operational processes.

This pandemic era, with velocity🏇, compels and ushers in AI (Artificial Intelligence) Machine learning, Internet of Things etc., with little or no options. 

What’s the experience like in your space ?

"When we are working with image datasets, it is usual that our images come from different sources, but not only that, probably  they were taken on different locations, with different illumination conditions and by different people. The light conditions play a fundamental role when classifying images, the heterogeneity of it can make difficult image classification tasks. One solution to this problem is Color Constancy, this paper is a good point to start with the fundamental concepts about it.

#mentalhealth. We use 
hashtag
#machinelearning to predict whether people seeking mental health treatment and group people and analyze their characteristics, use 
hashtag
#regression to find correlations, and finally to get some insights and suggestions to the human resources department.

After our analysis, we think companies should raise more awareness for providing access to mental health support to their employees and make them understand that both mental health and physical health are equally important. It is more likely that an employee stays healthy and becomes more productive if the company he or she works for cares about their mental wellbeing. It is very important to encourage employees to utilize and take advantage of existing mental health support programs.

"I had made an WebApp to summarise the document.
It is based on Node JS and Python.
Front-end of this WebApp is made using the ejs(embedded javascript template).
Server used is express server to route.
Back-end or you can say document processing works on python.
I had use two ways to summarise the document
i>> using my own python script based on nltk.
ii>> using the gensim_ext_sum library.

Document parsing is done using the pdfx.
While the file uploading and file management is done using multer.
If you choose to use my python script you need to install nltk, stopwords, and punkt.
While you are lazy like me you can use 2nd option which is quit easy, just by installing gensim_ext_sum.

Nowadays everyone is on the path of optimization of storage. If you are kind of who is on path of storage optimization you can use 2nd script. It requires much less storage space to execute.

The working of my project you can see on the link below on YouTube and don't forget to check out code on GitHub, suggestions are always welcome.

"Regression models have been around for many years and have proven very useful in modeling real world problems and providing useful predictions, both in scientific and in industry and business environments. In parallel, neural networks and deep learning are growing in adoption, and are able to model complex problems and provide predictions that resemble the learning process of the human brain. What’s the connection between neural networks and regression problems? Can you use a neural network to run a regression? Is there any benefit to doing so?
The short answer is yes—because most regression models will not perfectly fit the data at hand. If you need a more complex model, applying a neural network to the problem can provide much more prediction power compared to a traditional regression!

#machinelearning algorithms to retrieve multi-dimensional public sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic via a deep-dive analysis on tweets and news topics in this period. In this article, we:

·   Took an overall look at what happened on Twitter during the pandemic;
·   Extracted multi-dimensional sentiments and analyzed their trends;
·   Conducted topic analysis on news topics to aid our understanding of tweets.

We got this idea when participating in the UC Davis MSBA COVID-19 Challenge. Here we want to express our sincere thanks to MSBA leaders Amy Russell and Shachi Govil for providing this great opportunity, and we are grateful for the valuable suggestions from Prof. Ashwin Aravindakshan and Prof. Jörn Boehnke.

"""Longformer is a BERT-like model for long documents."" -Allen AI
""Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer's attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention""
