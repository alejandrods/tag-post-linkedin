are always present in 
Rotterdam and Houston 
and in Russian ports.
I represent Russian public refinery under the direction of the Russian energy ministry.
The Russian government always has these products available.
I don't represent private refineries or resellers.
The proceedings are not negotiable and there is no advance.
The prices are negotiable.
The refinery sends SGS to the buyer's farm.
The buyer must have a trusted tank farm.
The buyer's intermediaries must first agree the commissions with the buyer and then send LOI.

"Anyone can attain, provide, and relay a form of information. 📖 

However, if you're unable or unwilling to connect the information, hold discussions, apply it, form an opinion, or question it...what's the point? Will your learning be truly authentic? How will it impact your mental growth? 🧐

You could have a good memory or be skilled in test-taking... but just because you may retain information well does it really make you intelligent? 🤓❌

Knowledge is acquired based on facts, information, and skills through an individual's experience or practical and theoretical understanding of a subject matter. 🧠 

Knowledge is an ever-evolving construct and you can gain knowledge if you choose to have an open mind, a willingness to listen, and ask questions. 🤔

Become immersed and interact with the material you consume. Don't just read it and accept it as is. Almost anything and everything is open to interpretation. Form the connections aka LINK THE DOTS. ⚪️🔗⚫️

"As I was writing my 
hashtag
#newbook on 
hashtag
#datastorytelling, I had an interesting epiphany—data storytellers are change agents. Whenever we discover a new insight, the natural consequence of that insight is change. Stop doing that, and do more of this. Focus less on them, and concentrate more on these people. Spend less there, and invest more over here.

In our excitement to share our insights, we forget we're inviting change. There will always be resistance to change—even if it’s for the better. Author Dan Millman said, “The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.” Rather than trying to destroy the pre-existing narrative in our audience’s minds that may be based on outdated, incomplete, or erroneous data, we need to build a new narrative with our new insights. If you’ve read my book already, you know I place a lot of emphasis on driving action with insights. Data storytellers need to anticipate the resistance their insights will encounter. If we can craft our data stories more effectively, we can help mitigate and overcome this resistance to change. 

What has been your experience? What have been the biggest obstacles to inspiring change with

"Here are some thoughts to consider.

Resources are tight and you need to be able to do more with less. You need to minimise waste and streamline processes.

You've recently moved your business services and processes into the cloud. You need to understand and learn how to utilise all the bells and whistles you are paying for so as to maximise your investment.

You see your competitors succeed in some new initiative which you failed to identify in a timely manner.  

You need to understand technology better and how it can benefit your business: PaaS/SaaS/IaaS. virtualisation, DevOps,  data science/engineering/analytics.

You have wizz-bang computers/network/services but you don't understand why everything is running so SLOW.

You need someone who understands and is committed to business continuity.

You need to improve data accuracy, efficiency, and reporting.  End of financial year is fast approaching.

If you find any points relevant to your situation, then please do not hesitate to get in touch.

"As all business are facing unprecedented change, AI can help transform their operations to be more agile and more customer focused. Companies have to learn and teach their employees how to use AI to their benefit.

However, according to McKinsey, only 5% of all jobs can be fully automated thanks to AI. The nature of other roles will change with AI to improve them and make them more efficient. Companies may have to change their culture to embrace data, experimentation and agile principals. They also have to redesign their processes and their technological organizations.

There are 3 ways to facilitate the integration of AI for a company’s employees :
-Demystify artificial intelligence
-Develop trusted AI advocates
-Bolster existing business-intelligence efforts

DreamQuark’s Brain is a platform that allows business users in the Financial Industry to use state-of-art AI to go from data to action in a few clicks.

"The success of sales is not the result of performance.

When I first started working in the Middle East, they used to produce awards for servers who had the highest sales. My knowledge of statistics ended that. I created a spreadsheet dedicated to server performance, that I updated each day, and wrapped into a monthly report.  We then recognized by performance of all metrics.

I found this file on my computer and was absolutely astonished on how I broke down the numbers -- not bad for a former ""QSR guy.""

"Powerful, Fast Pivot Grid-
InSights Into Data can display the results of a query in a powerful pivot grid, rather than the standard result grid. This pivot grid allows the user to re-arrange the data to show the data in different ways, with different breakdowns. And it is all drag-and-drop. As well as looking at the raw data, it allow allows graphing - simply by selecting cells in the grid.
Pivot Grid
Here is a sample pivot grid showing a breakdown by sex of all prescriptions written at a clinic. Here the drug name and sex fields were dragged onto the grid and the data was automatically rearranged to what you see below. Note that a few cells have been selected which are then automatically graphed (as shown at the bottom).

I feel sorry for the graduates, and I have no fake advice to give. The market is worse than 9/11 and more than likely, you have no experience. 

But stick with it. Hope for the best and prep for the worse. If it's prolonged, realize that last in first out is real and don't get happy on your first salary and buy things. Save instead. 

Be flexible. If you have LinkedIn premium, you'll see a lot of post with 400+ applicants. Hold out for your dream job if you want, just realize that the life cycle to landing your first job is longer.

"Mixture experiments are a special class of response surface experiments in which the product under investigation is made up of several components or ingredients. Designs for these experiments are useful because many product design and development activities in industrial situations involve formulations or mixtures. In these situations, the response is a function of the proportions of the different ingredients in the mixture. For example, you might be developing an insecticide that blends four chemical ingredients.

#A great lesson to learn from one of the worlds best companies , General Electric for mid sized firms are :

1- In planning the"" middle ""is gone. We only have to define 2 points : where we plan to be 10 to 25  
hashtag
#years from now , and what we have to do in next 90 days . The 90 days point requires real time data and an executive team that can face the brutal reality of what the  
hashtag
#data is saying and then act accordingly . We don't need to fall or rise in love with our own 1-3 year plans.
2- Keep everything stupidly simple . If our strategies , plans , decisions ,  
hashtag
#systems , etc seem complicated , we are probably wrong . 
3- The best data is First Hand Data . This helps us to find out what's going in reality . 
4- We don't have a true  
hashtag
#strategy in place , if it fails to pass the following 2 tests 

  A- Does our strategy matter to our existing and potential customers .

  B- Does our strategy differentiates us from competition 

Try it out and we will succeed"

"No doubt Excel quite powerfull tools. It is also 'Cross-Platform' across  different roles in organization. 

Lets try out some Machine Learning Technique in Excel to develope a better understanding behind Machine Learning Algorithm / Statistical Calculation.

Excel can execute linear regression, ETS Forecast, ARIMA Forecast, even can transfer the working calculation behind Prophet Forecast to do it in excel. What's more ? Simple Machine Learning technique such as Decision Tree , Bayes and  kNN works like charms too.

and I do not try this yet - BERT toolkit ( https://bert-toolkit.com/) enable Excel wizard to load R Library and function to use it within Excel function. wow ! imagine I can test out some R algorithm in excel before completely build reproducible data product in R. ~ different datasets needs different treatment ~. The purpose of this to see how well the model fits into Business Operation / Domain.

Business Domain Knowledge must come first before any statistical technique.

If you got large datasets  - you can load to Excel Power Query / connect to your database / ETL tools. 

Dont forget about VBA, m code and DAX in excel too !

what's in it for you with Excel ?

"In February 2020, Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council were hit by ransomware attacks that caused some of their officials to resort to pen and paper in place of digital to keep services running.
 
When a data breach makes the news, businesses often learn new security lessons and are encouraged to reassess their own processes, policies and protection levels. 

It is important now more than ever to have sufficient security management and applications in place as businesses have more employees working from home. 

Ensure your security plans protect your business as best you can and you have measures in place to detect live threats and mitigate against them. Speak to our account team if you're looking to review your security strategy.

"Airflow ~ Datadog Integration:


The Airflow ~ Datadog Integration is the answer to  automate the monitoring of 
hashtag
#AirflowDAG failures by collecting useful metrics in Datadog and create Datadog Monitors across various platforms (ex: 
hashtag
#AWSEKS).

The 
hashtag
#DatadogAgent collects many metrics from Airflow, including those for:
 
hashtag
#DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs): Number of DAG    processes, DAG bag size, etc.
hashtag
#Tasks: Task failures, successes, killed, etc.
hashtag
#Pools: Open slots, used slots, etc.
hashtag
#Executors: Open slots, queued tasks, running tasks, etc.

Metrics are collected through the Airflow 
hashtag
#StatsD plugin and sent to Datadog’s DogStatsD.In addition to metrics, the Datadog Agent also sends service checks related to Airflow’s health.

A general overview of the 
hashtag
#dashboard created for  monitoring can be found in the attached screenshot.

"Knowledge or mere being aware has blurred the lines between a good and average leadership. 
This diagram depicts  differences  between Tacit Knowledge and Explicit Knowledge but also  between two kinds of Tacit Knowledge: Know Why and Know How. Tacit Know Why deals with values, feelings, motives, relationships and significance. Tacit Know How deals with intuitive interaction, habit, muscle-memory and competence. By contrast, Explicit Know What deals with facts, categories, models and metrics. Some might prefer to differentiate facts and metrics from categories and models. A problem arises when we conflate any of these three (or four) ways of knowing, imposing either 1. values, 2. skills, 3. data, or 4. categories as an exclusive or dominating epistemology. Why would we do this? It seems that psychological temperament,  social conditioning, educational experience and existential choice each play a role in deciding which of these ways of knowing we trust the most and assume to be regulative of the others. Even here there are those who will tend to pick only one or two of these four factors as the regulative and decisive ones, ignoring or minimizing the other factors that “just don’t agree with them”

"I get uneasy whenever I am returning something...from Amazon or any other retailer.

Because I see that reverse logistics (since it does not add to the revenue) is extremely neglected from an operational efficiency aspect.

So as someone passionate about operational efficiency, I rant everytime I am returning something 😑

So here is my latest rant about reverse logistics...and of course with some suggestions on how we can leverage analytics to solve for the problem.

The solution suggested in this video is parcel network backhaul optimization.

Extremely challenging but not impossible...for someone with Amazon's data infrastructure...since nearly real time visibility, immaculately maintained packaging and delivery asset volume data, and a high level of accuracy of many other types of data that will be leveraged, is the key to solve it.

Organizations currently have a multitude of other problems to solve for but few years from now, they should look into reverse logistics. It is attractive not only from $$$ aspect but sustainability angel is also very important.

Side note: If you are thinking why I got the weird haircut I am sporting in this video...it is a result of trying to cut my hair myself. 😁

"The 
hashtag
#bigquestion: ""Our 
hashtag
#martech stack generates a lot of data. We have data scientists. Why are we still unable to deliver a business case for 
hashtag
#marketing impact that protects us from these huge 
hashtag
#budget cuts?""

I'm going to unpack that over several posts. Here's 
hashtag
#Part2 -- 
hashtag
#DataScienceChallenges

There are 3 big reasons why many traditional DS teams fail to make an impact. These have little to do with the 
hashtag
#accuracy of the 
hashtag
#math or even data. 
hashtag
#Everyone has issues with 
hashtag
#data. 

The biggest challenges are 
hashtag
#operational.
hashtag
#Slow. Analytics teams often struggle to keep up with the business. They have to corral data, cleanse it, organize it...and that's before they even get to the computational bits. Their answers are often delivered weeks or months later -- too late for anyone to use them effectively.
hashtag
#Expensive. Talent is costly. This grates on executives who are already frustrated by how long it takes to get answers. It may not be fair, but it's 
hashtag
#reality.
hashtag
#Isolated. Analysts often don't have marketing or business knowledge, so they don't know what to focus on or how to explain the results to non-analysts.

"🔦 With the vast majority of companies employing nowadays a work from home policy, people have switched to cloud apps in greater numbers. That includes Office 365 apps, which also happen to be greatly sought after hackers. 

🔦 Such credentials are of use to bad actors looking to compromise systems and networks via remote desktop protocol (RDP) vectors or other methods. Since people tend to reuse credentials on multiple services, having access directly to stolen Office 365 credentials are very useful. 

🔦 No wonder RDP brute force attacks have gone up by more than 30% in the past couple of months.

I just finished my first one: TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game

This project allows you to apply the skills learned in the Intermediate Python course >>

-Matplotlib
-Dictionaries & Pandas
-Logic, Control Flow & Filtering

I found there is a bit of hand holding with this project as some of the code was already filled out (much like with the examples in the lectures)

Maybe they become more free form with more advanced topics??

What I did enjoy about this project is it gives you more exposure to typing out code so you can build that muscle memory 💪🏻🧠⌨

I hope you are all doing well. I am currently pursuing my MS in Management in Information Systems from Texas A&M University. I have been applying for summer internships and had given a couple of interviews for the position of business analyst which got canceled due to COVID 19. I have been utilizing this time to upgrade my skills through various online courses.

Considering the severity of the situation across the globe, I understand it is not going to be an easy road ahead, but I would like to use this platform and reach out to the LinkedIn community for support and assistance. I am currently looking for a summer internship in Data/ Business Analyst roles.

Enabling Project launches its new platform ‘Process Flows’
Enabling Project added a new platform on the website. Process Flows platform represents data for different feedstock, collected by different regions in 12 countries, and shows the process flows for the different feedstocks. Data is divided in two sections: 1. Feedstock availability & 2. Biobased products and Process Flows.
Project partners have collected feedstock availability data for different regions from their country, based on the public availability of data at regional level and Celignis has developed the platform for the process flows.
Click here to visit the platform and find out more.
2. Biobased Products and Process flows
Celignis has developed process flows for biochemicals and biopolymers production from various feedstock based on the composition data collected for the most important feedstock. The user can search for theoretical and practical conversion of 14 different products from sugar rich, starch rich and cellulose rich feedstock. The search also includes the two different Sectors (Biochemicals and Biopolymers) and the Products. The data is being constantly uploaded with the availability of the information.

"""It’s important to remember the proliferation of the edge is a result of demand, not a strategic choice of network owners."" - Angie McMillan

Sometimes, we look at the way the world is shaping up, and there's a tendency to think that corporations and businesses are defining the ways in which we live, work, and play. But the moves of business are made to meet the demands of...everyone else. Consumers want more data more quickly at a higher quality, and they want it now. Mission critical enterprises NEED the same.

Edge computing is moving more rapidly today than expected. That movement, that growth, is driven by want and by need. The edge will be from now forward supporting what may be a permanent shift towards an even more computer-driven society. 

It's occuring to me today that all of the predictions for the edge, the way it will shape and how fast it will do so, may very well go out the window this year. What we knew yesterday we have no knowledge of today. We no longer know the future of data and of edge computing. We know there will be increased need and demand, and that's it. 

What do you think is next for edge computing now?

The problem is that while crucial,

#Data is a static measurement that says ""this happened or didn't happen during this timeframe and at this place.""  It intrinsically lacks connection to anything else.

When the PM spoke on progressively easing the lockdown on Sunday evening, the clear message was that data will help guide us out of this crisis. 

Gathering, structuring, analysis and presenting data as clear insights has never been as mission critical. The team at Elixirr have been producing a daily insight and analysis dashboard which cuts through the noise and provides an objective view of the situation. 

If you’re a business leader or simply interested in understanding the spread and control of C-19, I highly suspect this will be right up your street. Let us know what you think!

"Logistic Regression 
It's classification problem algorithm , it's supervised learning problem we have numaric data , yes or no type values yes for 1 and no means 0 , so it's binary classification problem .

In logistic Regression we use probability to predict correct classification of data items , it's optimization technic .

It's two class problem so we devide training data into two class and set hyperplan between the classes to saperate data items and class . Then we use sigmoid function which is calculate the probability and by that sigmoid value we can predict the testing data is belong to class A or class B . 

If sigmoid value is .5 then testing data on the hyperplan which shows that the testing data is belong to both classes.

If testing data value is greater than .5 then it's belong to class A .

And if testing data value is smaller then .5 then it's belong to class B .

So we optimize correctly and predict yes and no type problems by Logistic Regression correctly .

"You may have asked yourself this question before: What kind of data analyst am I? Or how do my strengths fall into the emerging technologies of 2020? 

We are living in the future by the way. Data is power and you are the oracle. It’s very common and important to do a bit of self reflection and see what type of analyst you are in this data landscape. With the introduction of no-code machine learning, the type of analyst you are might have changed a bit.

Maybe you’re a Data Wrangler, or Innovator, Communicator, or the Machine Learning Mastermind.

Today I was working on a Bike share dataset.
I tried to clean and analyze the dataset.
Some of the questions I took to analyze are:
1. In which areas are the business established. 
2. Which time the usage of the service is more? 
3. What type of users are using the service. 
4. In which days the demands is high? 

Will continue to analyze the dataset and share the results here.

However, the recent F5 report shows that 66% of EMEA organisations are concerned with the lack of skilled security staff to support the increasing adoption of multi-cloud.
