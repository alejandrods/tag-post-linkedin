"Linear Regression Part 3: Code

Below is the link of a very basic linear regression code using Skelarn and taken R2 as metric 

https://lnkd.in/g_j5rSn 

Steps are quite simple:
1.    split the dataset using sklearn train_test_split.
a.     (X_Train, Y_Train) : use this to fit the model
b.    X_Test : use this to predict the values
c.     Y_Test : Do not touch it until you are measuring the accuracy stage
2.    Metric chosen : R2Score because it is one of the best metric from Regression analysis.If the R2Score value is closer to 1 then the model is better because the Sum of the squares of the Residual are almost equal to the Sum of the square of the Total.

"Causal Inference with Tableau and R

In my journey towards making data science more accessible to a non-technical audience. I used Tableau's end-to-end analytical capabilities to recreate my old project leveraging Tableau Prep (ETL) for data munging and Tableau Desktop powered by R script for Causal Inference.

Using this end-user can analyze the sensitivity of the matching algorithm and even change the treatment with a few clicks. 

Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts.

This video gives a sneak peek into the project. Check out the project here: https://lnkd.in/gs48rQd

Linear Regression Part -1

In Linear Regression the goal is to find the Best-Fit line which fits both the training and test data as well as possible, if we have only one dependent variable then the Best-Fit line will be a line, if we have more than one dependent variable the it will be a plane or hyperplane.
The Best-Fit line is a line or plane or hyper plane which minimizes the errors in each of the data-points in train and test.
Error for a given data point is calculated as (actual values – predicted value) but the problem with this equation is if the actual data-point is below the best-fit line then the error will be negative and for vice versa it will be positive, so while summing it may cancel out other errors, so we calculate the square of errors, and we try to minimize the square of the errors.

"Dear Data Scientists and Biostatisticians. I was preparing for this topic for a long time, seeing over and over how you are taught things that harm the science (and your reputation).

I'm gonna show you why the context-less outlier detection methods proposed practically everywhere, are almost useless, and why t̲h̲o̲u̲g̲h̲t̲l̲e̲s̲s̲ removal of outliers, instead of embracing and LEARNING from them, is so wrong.

After reading the attached document, you should be able to understand why people, who remove outliers blindly, without attempting to investigate it and who don't even try to learn the context, either completely don't understand what they do, don't care, or they lie intentionally.

Don't be an ignoramus, don't lie, investigate both missing data and outliers.

Outliers? I'll show you cases, where the truly worrying data aren't even visible.

❗autonomous AI, electronic engineering may need automated detection and removal (it may indicate need for shielding, filters, clipping).

Please reshare if you like. Help others to recover from that illness.

"Whenever I get bored or feel down or something like that, math is always there to help me. I love doing math, solving problems. I feel more energetic and relaxed after solving mathematical problems.
This specialization provided by Imperial College London through Coursera was a fantastic journey.
Though there was nothing new for me in the first course Linear Algebra and second-course Multivariate Calculus, I enjoyed them a lot. These were very intuitive. And the third one, Principal Component Analysis(PCA), it was a little tough since there're some new things. Learning new things especially math stuff is always fun.
And the most beautiful part was the programming assignments. Amazing.

I am grateful for these past 2 years. Not only was I pursuing my Master's but I was also a Full time Product Manager/ Business Intelligence Analyst @Ellucian for the past 1 year. I am so thankful for the incredible colleagues I have had, my family for immense support and the amazing professors @Syracuse University who helped me grow and get me where I am right now.

"Hello Everyone,
I am happy to share with you all that I’d successfully completed the 
hashtag
#DeepLearning 
hashtag
#Specialization on 
hashtag
#Coursera. I am sharing here my experiences, learning and realizations from this course.

1) With courses 1, 2 & 3 I’d learnt how to approach, optimize models, minimize errors and try to solve any real life problms.

2) Maths is very imp for doing EDA, Feature Engg, Optimizing  models e.g if one understands how back-prop and gradient descent works mathematically then it is easy to learn any Neural Nets. Here we can see actual implementation of maths in solving real world problms.

3) Courses 4 & 5 have detailed explanations of various state of the art DL algos. It explains How to use, When to use, What purpose we are solving and What are the limitations of these algos. It is very imp to realize this before using any algos.

4) Implementation of simple models without using libraries, provides better understanding of complex models, in finding errors and improving model.

5) The best way of learning is through solving assignmnts, practicing on problms from platform like 
hashtag
#kaggle.

6) One should be updated and try to learn and improve everyday. 
Thanks to

"Data scientists when they spend 3 days training their neural network but it performs 5% worse than random 🤪🤪

It really do be like that sometimes....

However - you can minimise this risk by deploying Occam's razor or The Law of Parsimony which states - ""entities should not be multiplied without necessity"" or more simply ""the simple solution is often the best one""

Start your machine learning tasks with some basic baselines and analysis so you can setup experiments to evaluate the gain for each incremental change in your modelling decisions or architecture. This is where the science aspect comes in handy!

Be wary of any assumptions you make in the process, more often than not - something simple and seemingly banal which you overlook, is THE difference between success and failure, especially when you need to deploy your final solution into a maze of production systems.

Simple is not the devil - the devil is in the details!

Happy machine learning - may all of your models train quickly and return great results this week! 🙌🙌🙌

"Are you planning to try Neural Networks architectures for answering natural language questions over tables? Read this work done by Google AI researchers in April 2020; it can be useful for you!

In summary, the authors extend the BERT architecture (i.e. a very famous SOTA NLP model invented in 2018 by Jacob Devlin et al.) to encode the question jointly along with tabular data structure, resulting in a model that can then point directly to the answer. If you want more details about their approach, please read their arXiv paper https://lnkd.in/dje75pU

Moreover, they have open-sourced their pre-trained weights of the model and the implementation too! Please, go to their GitHub repo here: https://lnkd.in/d-RzZjW

"Data science is a field where information comes from various sources, which in turn gets converted into valuable insights for business and IT strategies. The data collected from various sources can be structured, unstructured or semi-structured. Massaging the data, formatting the data, analyzing the data and extracting stories out of those data by dashboarding is a generic pipeline structure followed in the data science field.

This Data scientist course will take you through all these various tasks to well-versed you with every part of data science. While practicing Data science, you will come to know about various tools, algorithms and Machine learning principles that are usually used.

Usually people mistaken data science with business intelligence. However, both are completely different. In other words, a higher level of business intelligence can be called data science.

My thoughts:
EDA is one of the MOST important phase in this never-ending journey of Data Science. EDA gives really good insights of the data which will be further used to train ML models. Performing EDA on a particular dataset is different for different person and requires attention to the newly added techniques.

"Have you ever wondered how your Netflix and Amazon apps are able to make recommendations that suit your taste and preferences? What's the technology behind it anyway? It's Machine Learning. Data Scientists use ML to create recommendation systems. They collect consumer behavior data over time. Using this huge volume of data, they analyze and learn how consumers make choices. Finally, they produce data patterns that successfully predict consumer's needs and interests. Thus, enabling your Netflix and Amazon to show products of your personal interests.

so here's my take. As far as I can tell, no work has been published to date that provides a similar comprehensive comparison.

TL;DR - I fit cumulative case data to 7 different mathematical functions and found that the Richards model, an asymmetric logistic growth curve, worked best.

"*Read if anyone wants to do a short project using Spotify's data!*

I haven't shared content in a while. After rescinded offers and canceled interviews, I took a short break from my job search.
In that time, I focused on personal growth and exploring new hobbies.

Now that I am getting back to work, I feel rejuvenated and more enthusiastic about the search!

While I'll be sharing stuff again now, I have a few updates:
Some of you showed interest in my Analysis of Eminem's Album Trends (I'll link it in comments).
So, I have updated my GitHub with the code for my analysis. This code has a step-by-step explanation of accessing Spotify's APIs, writing Python scripts to automate HTTP requests, and formatting the data given by Spotify.

https://lnkd.in/gGs5gS6

If anyone wants to do a short project, you can use this code to get the data. You can do similar analyses for your favorite artists as well!
Feel free to reach out to me in case you need any inspiration or want to collaborate. I'd also love to hear from you if you use this code to do any project!

What happens when life is increasingly dictated by productionized models?

""To understand the menagerie of models that are fundamentally altering our individual and shared realities, we need to build a typology, a classification of their effects and impacts. ""

#DataAnalytics and

#AI?

This is an interesting question and one we get asked a lot. 

Typically, people talk about how many rows they have. To be honest, it doesn't matter whether you have a hundred, a thousand, a million or 7 billion rows of data.

The easy answer is ""as much as you can get your hands on"".  

But that's not the smartest approach for effective Data Analytics. What matters is understanding what you are trying to learn from your data. Once that's been defined the amount of data you need will become apparent.

"Monday Special: Web Scraping

Do you know Data Mining is a misnomer i.e. used interchangeably for Data Extraction, Information Processing, and Computer Decision Support systems?

This Monday I dug deeper and tried to get 360° angle of ""Web Scraping"". There are many web scraping software available in the market. Most of the Data Science professionals use Python package 'Beautiful Soup' and the R package 'rvest'. 

I found that in  Analytics Vidhya blog they explained Web Scraping very well: https://lnkd.in/gRUnkim

Check this out:
1) Beautiful Soup: https://lnkd.in/gKF44MQ
2) revest: https://lnkd.in/gSvyS_j

I just finished my first one: TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game

This project allows you to apply the skills learned in the Intermediate Python course >>

-Dictionaries & Pandas
-Logic, Control Flow & Filtering

I found there is a bit of hand holding with this project as some of the code was already filled out (much like with the examples in the lectures)

Maybe they become more free form with more advanced topics??

What I did enjoy about this project is it gives you more exposure to typing out code so you can build that muscle memory 💪🏻🧠⌨

"Numpy Trick #15 - Boolean Methods
.
Data Analysis is a crucial part where one needs to apply various methods as per the insight desired.
.
Consider a scenario where one needs to check if the elements in the array satisfy the given condition for all the elements or the other way round, does it satisfy for at least one element.
.
For such analysis one can use the ""all"" or ""any"" method as shown in the above trick. A simple example of using this technique can be to check if a patient has all the symptoms of a particular disease or not.

"3 years ago, when I moved from LTI - Larsen & Toubro Infotech (now LTI), I had humourously mentioned in my goodbye mail that I am looking for an algorithm that automatically filters only relevant Whatsapp messages and marks others as read, so it doesn't pop up in my android notifications (a customised spam filter). With minimum coding skills that I possesed at that time, it was just a concept, an idea.
Today, I think I have finally worked out the solution to my problem with the help of Python scripting and I am happy to share with you.
When executed this code checks for all the usernames/groupnames in my predefined array (all_names), and marks all the messages in that specific WhatsApp conversation as read.

Way ahead: 
1. I am working towards making this script auto-executable at a fixed time every morning
2. Looking to add a GUI interface, like a button or a widget on my phone homescreen that executes this script whenever I need during the day.

Simplified time-series analytics using the time_bucket() function

Two critical TimescaleDB time-series functions are: time_bucket()and time_bucket_gapfill(). Time_bucket() is used for aggregating arbitrarily-sized time periods and gapfill() is important when your time buckets have missing data or gaps, which is a very common occurrence when capturing 1000s of time series readings per second. Together, both of these are essential for analyzing and visualizing time series data.

Here it is in action:

SELECT time_bucket('5 minutes', time) AS five_min, avg(cpu)
  FROM metrics
  GROUP BY five_min
  ORDER BY five_min DESC LIMIT 12;

Because subject matter expertise goes a long way towards helping you spot interesting patterns in your data faster, the best analysts are serious about familiarizing themselves with the domain. Failure to do so is a red flag. 

As their curiosity pushes them to develop a sense for the business, expect their output to shift from a jumble of false alarms to a sensibly-curated set of insights that decision-makers are more likely to care about.

These form the basis for DBMS (Database Management Systems - the software that helps you add/modify/delete/maintain data). One of the prominent ways is ""Property Graph Models"". Their applications are plenty. One of the applications is ""Knowledge Graph"".

It’s very common and important to do a bit of self reflection and see what type of analyst you are in this data landscape. With the introduction of no-code machine learning, the type of analyst you are might have changed a bit.

Maybe you’re a Data Wrangler, or Innovator, Communicator, or the Machine Learning Mastermind.

The only way to know is to take our short quiz and find out!

"The complexity and rise of data in healthcare means that artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly be applied within the field. The key categories of applications involve diagnosis and treatment recommendations, patient engagement and adherence, and administrative activities.⠀
⠀
For instance, computer vision against X-rays shows promises to help detect diseases quicker; natural language processing (NLP) shows promises in drug safety. Although there are many instances in which AI can perform healthcare tasks as well or better than humans, implementation factors will prevent large-scale automation of healthcare professional jobs for a considerable period.

Statistics is generally considered a prerequisite to the field of applied machine learning. We need statistics to help transform observations into information and to answer questions about samples of observations.

So from yesterday till now I worked so hard to be familiar with some statics terms and definition to understand the next part of my course in data science using python. It is little bit of boring to study the theoretical part of statics. I completed lots of things about it. Now ready to dig down into the python which seems to be little bit interesting.

"Change in human behavior during the pandemic is affecting AI models --During the pandemic the world changed, people's behavior changed, and the data changed. ML models that were trained on normal human behavior run behind the scenes in inventory management, fraud detection, investing, marketing, recommendations, and more. ML models are designed to respond to changes but they perform badly when input data differs too much from the data they were trained on. In general, if a ML system doesn’t see what it’s expecting to see, then you will have problems and many businesses that use ML systems lack the expertise required to maintain them.

“The key skill that the best data scientists have” by André Sionek https://lnkd.in/gysQuhc"
"Bit of a break through tonight in our lab! 🚀

We are using machine learning to generate support and resistance (S&R) levels that are typically drawn on a chart by experienced quants or traders to help them identify dips or peaks for long/short trading strategies. 

The horizontal lines, shown on the chart below,  represent S&R levels. 
These lines have been generated***in their entirety*** by our proprietary ML algo 🤖

As a result, in one glimpse, a trader can see how close or far the price, of this derivatives contract, is from the S&R, helping to buy the dip or exit at the peak - without spending any time on manually generating these levels! 

An automated trading algo could also use these S&R levels as part of its long/short trading strategy decision criteria. 

We have also figured out how to run this algo optimally so it can generate rolling S&R levels,  to the second, for practically any asset class underpinned by an orderbook. 

If interested, please feel free to contact me for a labs demo.

Data
When talking data science, data is the first thing that should come up. We'll be working upon and investing entire time on it. Here are some traits about data.
1) Structured or Unstructured - Structured data is well represented into a fix schema eg. databases, excels etc. Working on it is easier as it makes more comprehensible. Unstructured data has no specific form, from a file on the drive to a physical document anything . It is converted into structured format first.
2)Quantitative and Categorical - Quantitative data is a measurable value telling the degree of a object. Categorical data tells about a properties, it can't be measured. It is a good practice to encode such data into numeric representations.
3)Big or Little - This is in terms with scale of data, usually the larger data we obtain better it is as it has less chances of missing any case. It can also be sampled to a smaller data set if required. A small data set on the other hand takes less time to analyse, takes less computing resources and easier to perform. Scale of data should be controlled problem to problem, for example if analysing voters mood in a constituency one can use a poll of 100-500 individuals rather than going on Social media and analyse all the posts and trends.

"Forecasting QLD public transport usage (pre COVID-19)

This post summarises some work I was conducting into determining ""what is the best statistical forecasting method for QLD transport data"" prior to COVID-19 social distancing.

The process of model comparison so far has been quite interesting, and has really highlighted that sometimes the most complex model isn't the best model for the job. Indeed, it can sometimes be useful to build some simpler models first, as I have done here, so you have a performance benchmark in addition to the usual residuals and test data accuracy.

Very keen to get back into this in the near future and work to build in some COVID-19 impacts."

"I recently worked on the Breast Cancer Dataset from kaggle. The goal was to predict whether a tumor is Malignant or Benign based on a number of features such as radius, texture, area, smoothness etc.
Here is my summary about the project :-
1. There was a class imbalance(1.68:1) which was dealt with by Oversampling the minority class (by generating synthetic examples in the train set) using the SMOTE class from imblearn Library
2. I used the SVM algorithm as there were only 500 examples to work on.
3. I used the Radial Basis Function(RBF) kernel for my SVM to make my decision-boundary curved.
4. I selected those feature that provided me with the highest accuracy (F1 score in this case) using the mlxtend library.
5. The Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) was used to visualize the problem. It tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes.The closer the curve comes to the 45-deg diagonal of the ROC space, the less accurate the model is. Scikit_plot library was used for plotting the same.
The Model Metrics and Visualisation is attached below.

"Right now I'm a little 'bit curious about data science and just learning how to use Python. I know it's a very small step. But then I believe the quotes I heard before, ""Small steps in the right direction can be turn out to be the biggest step of your life."" I don't know whether it's my right direction or not, but then I'd never get the answer if I don't make my first step.

"Glad to share my group's project on improving the efficiency of waste collection in the Dearborn area for Green for Life Environmental Inc. (GFL), a recycling company, as mentioned in the following article.

https://lnkd.in/gA6ZrXn

We had GFL's 171 days worth of waste collection data. We observed that on some days the company had ~4 hours of overtime work during the summer season. The problem statement involved reducing overtime costs. We solved this as an optimization and a network analysis problem and suggested solutions using linear programming and P-median models. Microsoft Excel, Tableau, and Sitation were the key tools used in creating models. Our recommendations included renting a new truck for summer and setting up a new facility location for future increase in demands.
