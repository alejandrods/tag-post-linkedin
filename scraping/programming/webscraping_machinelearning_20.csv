"You will see a step change from us at Arcanum to support a key component of the BCG/WEF recommendations:

3) Digital Transformation Acceleration:

""Well before the crisis, many businesses were pursuing digital transformation programmes. But what was a discretionary, self-paced transformation has become an urgent priority.

To compete dynamically on the rate of learning, organizations will need to be reconceived to combine human ingenuity with machine learning. Companies must focus on the human side of digital transformation at least as much as the technological side.""

"A lot of data science prep materials tell you to know the assumptions of regression - fewer get you ready for a question I love to ask: what happens to the bias and variance of coefficients in OLS when the different assumptions are violated, and why?

1. This question goes beyond memorization. Assumptions are somewhat easy to recall - what happens if you violate them is more challenging.

2. It often brings in real world experience. This is a really good ""tell me about a time when..."" type of question for more experienced candidates engaged in a modeling discussion.

3. The question tells you a lot about the candidate's understanding of statistics and attention to assumptions. In my opinion, most data science programs are too light on stats.

4. It bridges to another great question: what business impact would this have if a model with inflated bias/variance made it to production? It does a solid job connecting the idea to the real world implications.

Have a good weekend!

"A highly impactful use of AI ML has been personalization in the digital world.

Most products have adopted this trend by personalizing micro-content. Product owners shouldn't shy away from thinking about high-impact personalization of a product which could deliver completely personalized applications starting from onboarding, navigation and engagement.
 
For example, the navigation of an app could evolve to completely drop those links from the navigation bar, which a user visits only 5% of the time and replacing it with those links, which the user visits often.
 
Lets take Netflix as example. I am more fond of TV series, instead of movies. However, my husband is a big fan of Avengers Movies (Surprise!). If the main navigation on my Netflix account showed me categories of the TV shows & gave a link to Superhero movies for my husband, we both will have a more delightful experience! And this can be taken to the next level as the usage pattern of each user is identified and as it evolves over a period of time. Such application would evolve as the user's needs evolve with time and would stay more relevant to the user
 
Apps which will harness the true power of AI ML to provide more convenient and delightful experience would win in the long run.

#machinelearning to predict whether people seeking mental health treatment and group people and analyze their characteristics, use

After our analysis, we think companies should raise more awareness for providing access to mental health support to their employees and make them understand that both mental health and physical health are equally important. It is more likely that an employee stays healthy and becomes more productive if the company he or she works for cares about their mental wellbeing. It is very important to encourage employees to utilize and take advantage of existing mental health support programs.

#artificialintelligence is not only probably wrong- it's also probably bad for us.

This inspired me to pick up AI for Dummies (again😂) - I had to return it to the library before I finished it last time.

COVID-19 Analysis : 

Do you think we should use  c-means fuzzy clustering for showing people clusters?

Considering population density as low, medium & high. Can we use Bayesian Network to Model Epidemic impact"

Lars Ulbricht, me and our hard working team have developed wallbe in the past five years out of the German province village Schlangen onto this Map of Berlin Digital Group which depicts the leading German Smart Energy Techs - looks good & thank you!"
Excited to bring our knowledge and experience into the public sector!

Amazing app!
"I am often asked - “how do I get my first job in machine learning?” My answer always has been - build a portfolio- through internships, Kaggle and personal projects.

This is a great thread on the perspective of a hiring manager on such portfolio projects - use messy data, focus on a applied problem statement, product oriented development and keep it to the point- I agree!

"Check out what I've been working on at The Knowledge Society (TKS)! 

For the past few months, I've been deeply researching how microbes in the gut communicate with the brain, thus affecting mental health.

I'm currently using machine learning models to analyze gut microbiome composition of depressed patients and seeing if I can create an accurate diagnostic.

If you know someone in the field, or are yourself in the field, I'd love to connect!

Using this lock down to learn about technologies that has always fascinated me.
Artificial intelligence has been one such area of interest for me and finally I was able to learn the basics of the same.
Thank you Andrew Ng  for explaining AI in very simple terms with the help of various use cases.
Looking forward to many such courses in the coming future!

"The course description says you will be able  to :
 - gain a practical understanding of Apache Spark, and apply it to solve machine learning problems involving both small and big data.
I think IBM courses are in general good and take you to the point I did learn a lot from this course still, it was not as practical as I was expecting.
I got my 4th badge at IBM and it feels good actually it gives kind of a push toward learning more and more.
Let's keep learning as we are staying at home.
Let's keep learning for that one opportunity.

"So glad to announce that our article has been published by Towards Data Science! 

Written by Xingxuan Zhang, Xinyue (Willa) Yu, Aijie Li and me, this article covers how we utilized 
hashtag
#machinelearning algorithms to retrieve multi-dimensional public sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic via a deep-dive analysis on tweets and news topics in this period. In this article, we:

·   Took an overall look at what happened on Twitter during the pandemic;
·   Extracted multi-dimensional sentiments and analyzed their trends;
·   Conducted topic analysis on news topics to aid our understanding of tweets.

We got this idea when participating in the UC Davis MSBA COVID-19 Challenge. Here we want to express our sincere thanks to MSBA leaders Amy Russell and Shachi Govil for providing this great opportunity, and we are grateful for the valuable suggestions from Prof. Ashwin Aravindakshan and Prof. Jörn Boehnke.

"""Longformer is a BERT-like model for long documents."" -Allen AI
""Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer's attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention""

I am graduating soon with a Master in Computer Science with a focus in Machine Learning. My Bachelors was in Physics and I have a love for solving complex problems. While I am putting in the hours looking for an entry level position and/or internship, I thought I would drop a public message here and see if anyone is looking for someone with explosive potential but you can pay at bargain market rates. I can be a great investment.
