"Brilliant article (also available here: https://lnkd.in/gtP64C6), articulating views I completely identify with. 

TL/DR, and with apologies (you do need to read it): 

- labelling is unhelpful (not only everything as AI, but also arbitrarily creating subdivisions); 
- know about and respect what you are building on; 
- see beyond the tool to the application (e.g. IoT is fine as a start, but there's a lot more to making better decisions); 
- focus on creating (""engineering"") something useful, not the perfect end game of AGI."
