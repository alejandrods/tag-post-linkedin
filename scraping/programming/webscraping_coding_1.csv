"Threats come from all areas, from malware attacks to compromised user credentials, and even accidental data leaks caused by human error. Naturally, it follows that an effective security system should have tools to cover all these areas.

Using tools like Azure Active Directory and Single Sign On, you can protect your system from common user credential problems while Azure Information Protection can keep your data encrypted and secure even if it's shared outside of your system.

We the Cyber-security team at Sahara Net understand the security problems facing your business are far from simple, which is why our multifaceted solution contains tools to address each one.

"With the demand for video interviews going through the roof, we have rolled out some powerful features to our technical video interviewing platform.

1. Evaluation parameters - Structured interviews are seeing increased adoption and we now support defining evaluation parameters on which each candidate has to be scored after the interviews - hence allowing you to conduct structured interviews.

2. System Design interviews - We all know how hard it can be conduct system design interviews even on a video call. We heard your feedback and we have integrate Draw .io that allows you to create block diagrams and architecture design in a live interview.

3. Multiple interviewers - We heard your requests and have increased the number of interviewers from 3 to 5. Up to 5 interviewers can be part of the same interview. This is great for scenarios where you want to do pair programming, shadow interviews, or conduct an interview in a panel.

"When was the last time you learnt something?

Whether it be professional or personally, goals are set in pursuit of solving a problem. The only way to solve that problem is through learning and growth. 

I used to think that some tasks could only be done by the experts, and that there was no point for me to spend time trying to learn something I didn‚Äôt even know existed.

So, when the need for a new app for my customers emerged, I reached out to an expert in the field.  Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt impressed by the service offered and so the journey began; I decided to learn how to do it myself.

In half of the time quoted by the expert, I had learnt coding, and I had a prototype that worked. Now, it wasn‚Äôt easy, but the more I learnt, the more I realised how beneficial this would be for me in the long run. And most of all, I get to improve the prototype to my customer requirements before starting building a scalable product.

How did I learn these things? By motivation and reading ‚Äòthe manual‚Äô. Failure is often part of the journey but acquiring knowledge is advantageous for both your professional and personal life.

What change are you going to make today? You might surprise yourself and learn something üòä

"An interview is probably the one thing that will survive across time for choosing the right candidates for jobs and as the Covid-19 pandemic throws traditional interviewing practices out the window. 

We at HackerEarth have recently expanded the capabilities of our FaceCode live interview tool to ensure that our clients can keep hiring with confidence no matter the situation. Here are a few key takeaways from the latest release,

1. Evaluation parameters - Structured interviews are seeing increased adoption and we now support defining evaluation parameters on which each candidate has to be scored after the interviews.

2. System Design interviews - We all know how hard it can be to conduct system design interviews even on a video call. We heard your feedback and we have integrated Draw .io that allows you to create block diagrams and architecture designs.

"**workattech slack group**

<<Check 1st comment for details>>

We created WhatsApp groups few months back but there were people with diverse seniority levels and interests in each group.

Because of this we could not share many resources as something relevant to a student might not have been relevant to a senior folk and vice versa.
---

We're finally moving to slack so that people can join channels based on their interest.

I encourage you to join and start healthy discussions in the topic of your interest. üòÉ

Happy learning!

Please share this with people who might benefit from joining the channels.

"Today's 
hashtag
#SmoothstackSpotlight is on Rufat Aghayev!

Growing up, 
hashtag
#softwareengineering was not one of Rufat‚Äôs dreams or aspirations. He longed to become a TV host, and actually worked in 
hashtag
#entertainment for several years as a TV and radio host for the #1 network in Azerbaijan (ATV) hosting talk shows, music contests, and radio shows. He always enjoyed exploring new cultures and cities, however it wasn‚Äôt until he visited NYC for a work trip that he considered a permanent move.

Rufat was looking for a new creative outlet, and realized the 
hashtag
#tech industry was a rapidly changing field of opportunity, and in 2018, he moved to NYC to study 
hashtag
#computerscience at Flatiron School. From there he joined Smoothstack's 
hashtag
#apprenticeship where he decided he wanted to be a resource to his fellow students and accepted a TA position.

‚ÄúOne thing that makes Smoothstack really special is how the curriculum is determined by the client on day one... ensuring we add value to organizations as soon as we start.

My background as a host makes me very comfortable leading a group of students. I think it‚Äôs important to show you can be confident in this environment when there‚Äôs this expectation that you‚Äôre working alone behind a computer all day.‚Äù

Thank you, Rufat!

"Sorry for bursting your bubble guys but your solution isn‚Äôt always optimized as it seems on leetcode runtime distribution.
Or vice-versa.

I submitted my solution, mine solution runtime was showing 256ms and the most optimized one was 196ms.
So I thought of comparing both on my machine.

Guess what? Mine is faster. I tried many times, there is always a large difference in the result.

I guess distribution differs because of submission at different points of time. It runs on different machines at different points of time (runtime varies machine to machine).

So CHILL don‚Äôt bother about the runtime. :p

Starting with the April release of Flutter, it is moving to a branching model with a stabilization period for beta and stable releases. It will now branch at the beginning of the month for a beta release and stabilize this release by cherry-picking any critical fixes.

"Greetings to All!

I am happy to see a good response for my last post on NumPy. This 100-day programming challenge has taught me a lot.

Today's topic is, advance Numpy where I will be discussing broadcasting, fancy indexing, and multithreading.

Attached is my GitHub repo and I am happy to share this. I was first sceptical about learning these topics. But later I understood with consistent focused effort, we can learn anything. 
Remember a famous quote ""Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it - Albert Einstein""

"Week 5 of coding bootcamp is kind of blowing my mind.  The concepts we've been studying so far in Java have had steady expansions with each week, but I feel like the leap into object oriented programming has more significance.  Though my understanding as I to go through the lessons hasn't been without speed bumps, I think I'm following with enough clarity.  In sum, I feel like I'm seeing a powerful potential with OOP that  has a lot of weight to it over the previous weeks' material.

Thank you for a wonderful session, I look forward to building upon what I have learnt!

"Autonomous Medical Coding- 

I have never been a committed supporter of Computer Assisted Coding due to real concerns with coding accuracy and the inordinate amount of time for the system to adapt and become productive and useful for the hospital that implements CAC. About a year ago I had the opportunity to see Nym's autonomous coding solution in action at a hospital site and was really impressed by its functionality and accuracy in code assignment. 

I highly encourage you to register and check out this coding solution for yourself on May 19th. Worth looking at as an alternative to CAC.

"Thanks! Leading India AI for this opportunity. The course was relatively simple. Though its pretty surprising that you don't really need to be an expert in Deep learning in order to create an efficient DL model. 
The concept of optimizing available similar Dl models to your own problem statement by training selective layers and not getting a significant degradation in performance was a huge shocker to me !
Not only this give you a relatively well trained model but also helps you save resources (Time, Data, Computation-Power, etc)

"Based on what other nations are experiencing at this moment, we must be prepared for second, third, and fourth waves of this infection. 

Unfortunately, beating this disease is harder than most would think. For us to beat it, we must first be sufficiently scared of it - it could happen to you, or anyone in your family. 

Then comes the necessity of good hygiene and proper precautions against this virus. These are a must if we have to break the chain of transmission and thus flatten the curve.

And finally here is something which must not be missed - the only defence you have against a viral disease is your immune system. Doctors and medicines are also only helping the immune system do its job. The vaccine also only serve as a learning experience for the immune system.

Thus it is very important that one and all maintain their health. Eat good food, get good exercise, and stay sane.

"Nothing feels better when you accomplish a small personal goal you thought was going to take forever! One of my goals that accomplished between yesterday and today was learning how to use Mozilla's Developer tools! It may seem like a small task but it took a little time for my brain to wrap around exactly how to put these tools to use.

But now, I'm able to make quick and efficient changes to my web projects by testing them out in the browser before I insert them into my code. I'm able to check the accessibility of my project to ensure it meets the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. And it overall improves my efficiency as a coder!

If you're not using them yet and haven't tried to use them, go ahead and try them out! Read through a little documentation or just jump into them like I did! Maybe they help you out at becoming a better coder!

Before we analyse the data the main thing that we must do is
Extract the data.
In some cases the data might be available in a readable form, but there are some cases where you need to extract it.
Today, I was trying to use tweepy to extract data, as I wanted to analyse the archive of a popular account.
To gather this data I defined the file - url, request this url and write the content of the response to a separate file.
I will update the analysis once I'm done

I decided to start an online community to help other people in tech like me, who are trying to adjust to work life during shelter-in-place and coronavirus. This community will be for anything from venting, to advice, to job openings.

Appium is like an umbrella over android and iOS drivers.

I believe, Appium is the best option when you have cross-platform built app i.e. same featured app for both android and iOS.

Another thing I liked about Appium is that it has an awesome documentation (http://appium.io/) with various languages - Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C# and PHP.

If you know someone affected please point them in our direction."
Mehul Smriti Raje - alumnus who inspires

"Remember, that T9 dictionary??
Even on those feature phones with practically negligible space, compared to what we have today... How they were able to search so fast over a million words.

As a kid that amazed me so much. I never thought a simple data structure made it all possible.

Name of the data structure - TRIE
 
Today I learned what literally effects and optimizes our search daily. 
The google instant search suggestions. Yes, they are all TRIE.

 This one is too good to be missed.

I checked it out and finished the introductory course which covered the basic syntax and Numpy library functionalities, in addition to some statistical exercises. I started the Data Science Courses enrollment as well, hoping to get further knowledge in this domain.

"New generation of HEC Data Minds is coming!
 
HEC Data Minds is the professional student club at HEC Paris that brings data ‚Äúliteracy‚Äù and science to the students of our Business School through various formats. 
Have a look at our website www.hecdataminds.com 

In my capacity as President of our association, I was honored to lead our diverse team of over 30 impressive members from 19 countries, which was a rewarding and insightful experience that I will never forget.

A big THANK YOU to the whole team, in particular my  dedicated board members without whom all this would not have been possible: Nathan, Rebecca, Monica, Basit-us-Salam, Jan, Anthony.
 
I am very confident that the new board represented by ƒåedomir, Benedikt and Louis will continue the successful mission of HEC Data Minds. Good luck guys!

I would also like to thank 
hashtag
#HECParis and our key partner Banque Populaire Val de France (Fran√ßois Batiot) for their great support.

If you are interested in a partnership, then don‚Äôt hesitate to contact Benedikt Kruft.

I am already excited to see which great events the new team will organize next year!

"Difficult times call for difficult measures. Maybe it's time to think about putting safety measures that we never have before.

Phishing attempts have increased tremendously due to the COVID-19 crisis, and many of them reach the endpoint because remote employees are lacking the walls of security they had in-office. Maybe it's time we refrain from emails temporarily. Maybe it's time to block all emails with attachments or links. There are other ways we can communicate for the time being. Safety should be our number one concern.

For any CISOs out there that may be wondering how to go forward, recognize that your safety precautions put in place at the beginning of the year are gone. 2020 is a whole new ball game. Let's rebuild our roadmap together!

"Even More Python for Beginners: Data Tools by Microsoft

Aspiring data-science and machine-learning developers now have more Microsoft-made free video tutorials to learn how to build software in Python, one of today's most popular and versatile programming languages.

The new More Python for Beginners series consists of 20 videos that run between two minutes and 15 minutes each. It covers working with files, lambdas or 'anonymous functions',

And object-oriented programming and each tutorial are followed by a short demo video. The tutors also introduce some newer functionality to support asynchronous development through async/await.

"Social Distancing Analyser
==================

According to WHO, at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between persons are must to reduce the spread of corona virus (COVID-19). To analyse Social distancing in a public places and carry out necessary actions to better deal with the pandemic, I developed a model which can analyse social distancing parameters by detecting distance between two persons.

This is just a demo applied on a small video, I got to learn a lot with this project. Hope you will like it.

"Here‚Äôs my little humble story to hopefully inspire you for the upcoming week!

I was born into poverty where clean water was a luxury. But ever since I could remember, I‚Äôve always known that I could be and do whatever I set my mind to.

I struggled with self-worth after loosing my parents. I thought doing good in school would boost my worthiness and be more significant to the people around me, which I craved. I would skip lunch to study, taking night classes (most of the time I would pay for the classes with the money I earned from recycling because I didn‚Äôt wanted to bother my aunt). Hard work definitely pays off, I was one the highest ranked in class for 6 straight years.

4. Demand of yourself to become who you need to become in order create the life you desire.

"Learning a new language is fun. But developing a whole new language is challenging as well as exciting. As a part of my coursework, I have developed this new language Decaf20. It is more similar and simpler version of C, developed in python. The library I have used is PLY.lexer, only for the lexical analysis part. Further work can be done on code optimization, especially for the machine code generation part. I am really happy to share this!

"üíª Data Structures and Algo - Day 1:

What are Data Structures? They are nothing but a bunch of Uhaul boxes, movers, trucks and storage units trapped in a computer. 

All we are doing is to define, move, manipulate and manage these boxes. They often move from one place to another. Data is a nomad.

The simple logic is: first, we define a data structure (i.e. Uhaul medium box), then, organize/manipulate the data (i.e. insert your office supplies in the box), then return the data (your Uhaul box is ready to go). 

Insert, search, remove are sample examples of operations we can perform on data structures (after you think you packed all the office supplies, you find a keyboard laying around, and you open the Uhaul box to insert it). The type of the data structure (i.e. Uhaul box), will define what operations we can do with it. Not all are the same. There are also relationships between data structures, for example: kitchen related Uhaul boxes all belong to ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù,  office related Uhaul boxes all belong to ‚Äúoffice‚Äù etc.  

*U-Haul is an American moving equipment and storage rental company.

Can you think of a data structure from a daily life?

"This is my favourite tutorial video I've created so far. Why? Because I get to cover the basics of coding in it!

""But Chanel, aren't you specialized on G Suite and apps like Gmail, Google Sheets, Goole Meet, etc.? Have you gone back to teaching how to code?""

You see, I have specialized on the G Suite apps BUT you can automate (almost) any of these Google apps by writing code in Google Apps Script! Or you can create add-ons for you and your team. Or even program a web application, and many more things. 

And you know what? To write Google Apps Script you don't even need a paid G Suite account. A free Google account will do.

Have a look at the video to get an idea of what's possible with Google Apps Script. Let me know if you have any questions.

I coded a simple Android app using Java that notifies users how many times they have clicked a button.

I developed this app to further instill basic knowledge of app design layout, button functionality, and text input queries. One of the key elements of becoming a good developer is continually reviewing the basics in order to provide a strong foundation upon which to gain higher-level coding skills and techniques.

"Several years ago, I found myself disillusioned with software engineering, so I explored a career shift.  I'd become fed up with the long hours in front of the monitor, the ""nerd status"", and the buggy lines of unmaintained code that littered the industry.  It seems sooner or later, every programmer faces a question of whether to continue coding or explore another path... I've seen numerous of my own colleagues gone off to become bartenders, restaurant owners, or live on a farm.  Having saved enough, I myself went

#YOLO and chased a dream of film & travel... After 2 years of mild success though, I would return to the corporate offices, having understood what I'd taken for granted about the programming life... Here's the story:

"we need to type macchanger, options and then the device.
Now in order to check out our available options, we can type here, as it says, try macchanger
--help.
So we will type macchanger --help and it will basically show us right here some of the available
options that we can use. Right now, in order to find out what our mac address is,
we want to use this option, which is --show or -s.
Now if we just type here macchanger -s, it will say that we incorrectly used this program because
we didn't specify the device.
Now this device basically means your network interface card. You might be having multiple interface cards
so we want to pick one. If you type here
ifconfig, as we covered in the previous tutorials,
it will print you up with your network interfaces. Right here
I only have the LOOPBACK interface
and the eth0 interface, which I use to connect to the Internet.
