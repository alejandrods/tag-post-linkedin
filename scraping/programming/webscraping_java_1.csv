"While not exactly the most visually impressive, I’m very proud of this project. There were many firsts for me in this school assignment. The goal was to create a web application using Java Servlets and JSP that allowed the user to add and view information from an Oracle database. This is the first web application I’ve created completely from scratch, database to UI. It’s the first time I’ve worked with Servlets and JSP. The first time I’ve sent and received data from a database. I’ve learned so much from this project. Seeing the entire process front to back has connected many dots that have previously been a mystery. I’m excited to take this new knowledge and put it to use creating even more technically impressive applications. While a small victory, I feel very accomplished. 🙌🏻

"Hello Folks,

Hope you are doing well.

Being an Android developer, I know that technologies are changing very rapidly now a days. After Android SDK, Flutter provides a strong and better environment for us to create amazing apps. I have started learning Flutter few months ago by myself.

Few of my friends/colleague approached me as they find a lot of trouble to understand the concepts of Flutter SDK from Basic to advance level.

Instead of helping them individually I have created an application that will help everyone to understand all of Flutter features easily.

This application have all the required information in detail which you would need while working on Flutter environment.

I am open to any suggestion that can make this application more valuable to you all.

"I NEVER EVER wanted to learn to write code or program.

I was scared and afraid and didn't see the value or use.  

It was like walking into AP Calculus class junior year.

Why do I even need math?  When will I ever use this?

Eventually I saw dollar signs and green pastures.

So, I would go to Barnes & Noble and read books about coding.

#Java, 
hashtag
#HTML, 
hashtag
#Python, 
hashtag
#C#, 
hashtag
#PHP, 
hashtag
#JavaScript.

I kept my determination, practiced, and eventually it was easy to code.

A couple months later I was offered a job for $20K more per year.

I was very happy.  

I want this same happiness for you.

"A lot of my friends who had offers are getting laid off or offers are getting revoked, putting them back in the job market.
I just conducted a mock coding interview for one of them and it was a lot of fun and I'd like to do more, because I want to help other people and it helps me get a better idea of what the interviewer wants. So if anyone here wants to do a mock interview (either as the interviewer or interviewee) shoot me a DM and we can figure something out. My main languages are Java and Python but I can basically interview you in any language you want.
