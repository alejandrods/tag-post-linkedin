hashtag
#100daysofcode 

Started to focus more on OOP (Object Oriented Programming) working with a class syntax. OOP is an area that I need to focus and work more on.

Currently working on simple board game/card game projects to strengthen my use of 'Classes'.

"Recently, I was fortunate to take part in a 2 day Introduction to Coding Webinar with TAPintoTech and SEO London .

It was an enjoyable, interactive session where I used Python to create a login system. In particular, it was interesting to learn about the use of Python in the world of finance, such as algorithmic trading. Overall, it was a great experience to broaden my knowledge in coding.

Thank you for a wonderful session, I look forward to building upon what I have learnt!

"New generation of HEC Data Minds is coming!
 
HEC Data Minds is the professional student club at HEC Paris that brings data “literacy” and science to the students of our Business School through various formats. 
Have a look at our website www.hecdataminds.com 

In my capacity as President of our association, I was honored to lead our diverse team of over 30 impressive members from 19 countries, which was a rewarding and insightful experience that I will never forget.

A big THANK YOU to the whole team, in particular my  dedicated board members without whom all this would not have been possible: Nathan, Rebecca, Monica, Basit-us-Salam, Jan, Anthony.
 
I am very confident that the new board represented by Čedomir, Benedikt and Louis will continue the successful mission of HEC Data Minds. Good luck guys!

I would also like to thank 
hashtag
#HECParis and our key partner Banque Populaire Val de France (François Batiot) for their great support.

If you are interested in a partnership, then don’t hesitate to contact Benedikt Kruft.

I am already excited to see which great events the new team will organize next year!

"Thanks! Leading India AI for this opportunity. The course was relatively simple. Though its pretty surprising that you don't really need to be an expert in Deep learning in order to create an efficient DL model. 
The concept of optimizing available similar Dl models to your own problem statement by training selective layers and not getting a significant degradation in performance was a huge shocker to me !
Not only this give you a relatively well trained model but also helps you save resources (Time, Data, Computation-Power, etc)

"Even More Python for Beginners: Data Tools by Microsoft

Aspiring data-science and machine-learning developers now have more Microsoft-made free video tutorials to learn how to build software in Python, one of today's most popular and versatile programming languages.

The new More Python for Beginners series consists of 20 videos that run between two minutes and 15 minutes each. It covers working with files, lambdas or 'anonymous functions',

And object-oriented programming and each tutorial are followed by a short demo video. The tutors also introduce some newer functionality to support asynchronous development through async/await.

"Sorry for bursting your bubble guys but your solution isn’t always optimized as it seems on leetcode runtime distribution.
Or vice-versa.

I submitted my solution, mine solution runtime was showing 256ms and the most optimized one was 196ms.
So I thought of comparing both on my machine.

Guess what? Mine is faster. I tried many times, there is always a large difference in the result.

I guess distribution differs because of submission at different points of time. It runs on different machines at different points of time (runtime varies machine to machine).

So CHILL don’t bother about the runtime. :p

"Social Distancing Analyser
==================

According to WHO, at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between persons are must to reduce the spread of corona virus (COVID-19). To analyse Social distancing in a public places and carry out necessary actions to better deal with the pandemic, I developed a model which can analyse social distancing parameters by detecting distance between two persons.

This is just a demo applied on a small video, I got to learn a lot with this project. Hope you will like it.

It is more similar and simpler version of C, developed in python. The library I have used is PLY.lexer, only for the lexical analysis part. Further work can be done on code optimization, especially for the machine code generation part. I am really happy to share this!

Before we analyse the data the main thing that we must do is
Extract the data.
In some cases the data might be available in a readable form, but there are some cases where you need to extract it.
Today, I was trying to use tweepy to extract data, as I wanted to analyse the archive of a popular account.
To gather this data I defined the file - url, request this url and write the content of the response to a separate file.
I will update the analysis once I'm done

"Greetings to All!

I am happy to see a good response for my last post on NumPy. This 100-day programming challenge has taught me a lot.

Today's topic is, advance Numpy where I will be discussing broadcasting, fancy indexing, and multithreading.

Attached is my GitHub repo and I am happy to share this. I was first sceptical about learning these topics. But later I understood with consistent focused effort, we can learn anything. 
Remember a famous quote ""Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it - Albert Einstein""

Once again, thank you all for your support. See you in my next post. Have a safe day!

"What are the best resources to learn git, workflows, actions and APIs? 👨‍💻
.
.
(1) Version Control Git course (https://lnkd.in/gfEaa2b) ♠️ on Coursera offered by Atlassian and taught by Steve Byrnes is the best course to learn VCS. 🏁

(2) GitHub labs (https://lab.github.com/) will give you hands on 👐 learning experience for VCS as well as workflows and github actions. 🚩

(3) Github GraphQL Explorer (https://lnkd.in/g9vh2bn) 🔥 is platform to test your queries before including them to your code. 🎌

(4) For Github REST APIs, the best resource is the documentation (https://lnkd.in/gWjAsSp). 💡

Feel free to add more resources in comments! ☺️

"Several years ago, I found myself disillusioned with software engineering, so I explored a career shift.  I'd become fed up with the long hours in front of the monitor, the ""nerd status"", and the buggy lines of unmaintained code that littered the industry.  It seems sooner or later, every programmer faces a question of whether to continue coding or explore another path... I've seen numerous of my own colleagues gone off to become bartenders, restaurant owners, or live on a farm.  Having saved enough, I myself went

"Someone recently said it is a good measure of a company not how they behave when times are good, but when times are tough. QA is doing the right thing to support those who are furloughed or have been made redundant at a difficult time globally for many companies, an opportunity to upskill or reskill individuals through free live training with world class trainers. If you know someone affected please point them in our direction."

"💻 Data Structures and Algo - Day 1:

What are Data Structures? They are nothing but a bunch of Uhaul boxes, movers, trucks and storage units trapped in a computer. 

All we are doing is to define, move, manipulate and manage these boxes. They often move from one place to another. Data is a nomad.

The simple logic is: first, we define a data structure (i.e. Uhaul medium box), then, organize/manipulate the data (i.e. insert your office supplies in the box), then return the data (your Uhaul box is ready to go). 

Insert, search, remove are sample examples of operations we can perform on data structures (after you think you packed all the office supplies, you find a keyboard laying around, and you open the Uhaul box to insert it). The type of the data structure (i.e. Uhaul box), will define what operations we can do with it. Not all are the same. There are also relationships between data structures, for example: kitchen related Uhaul boxes all belong to “kitchen”,  office related Uhaul boxes all belong to “office” etc.  

*U-Haul is an American moving equipment and storage rental company.

Can you think of a data structure from a daily life?
