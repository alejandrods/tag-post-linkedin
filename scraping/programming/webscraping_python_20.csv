hashtag
#ETL processes. pygrametl is maintained by our colleagues Christian Thomsen and S√∏ren Kejser Jensen. 
pygrametl has had a successful reach in the industry. A recent experience (https://lnkd.in/gav2Y6E) was shared by Catalyst IT (https://catalyst-au.net), a global team of open source experts that specialise in developing, designing, and supporting enterprise-grade open source solutions. 

The main strengths of pygrametl mentioned by Catalyst IT were:
1. Lots of good code examples in the documentation.
2. Clever implementation of Dimension and Fact Table inserts and updates. Migration of legacy logic and data warehouse table structure with minimal changes.
3. The framework is built on the power of python, meaning any bespoke scripting transformations are easy even for a novice python developer.
4. Easy to run on pretty much any Linux environment.

"Getting Started with NumPy:

Before you jump into data science or machine learning, it is good to have some knowledge and basic skills on certain things. When I started to explore data science, one of my lecturers told me to learn the most used packages for data science namely NumPy, Pandas, etc. So, I took an online course from Edx which really helped me to grow my skills in those packages.

Today I will share a notebook that contains the fundamentals and some tips and tricks of NumPy. This will motivate you to learn more in the data science domain. This is totally for beginners who have just started to explore data science.

These following topics are covered in this notebook:

- Rank-1 Array.
- Rank-2 Array.
- 2x2 array of zeros
- 2x2 matrix with the diagonal 1s and the others 0
- Slice Indexing
- Boolean Indexing
- Array Operations (Arithmetic, Statistical, Sorting)
- Broadcasting
- Speed Test
- Dot Operations and many more.

I hope you all will like it. Enough of talking let's jump into the notebook. Happy Hacking.

"Hi everyone, 
I had finished the course "" Machine Learning A-Z‚Ñ¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science"" though Udemy. I really recommend this course to those who wants to learn to create Machine Learning Algorithms in Python and R. 

This course has been designed by two professional Data Scientists so that they share their knowledge and help you learn complex theory, algorithms and coding libraries in a simple way. 

The course is packed with practical exercises which are based on real-life examples. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice building your own models. And this course includes both Python and R code templates which you can download and use on your own project. 

Interested in the field of Machine Learning? Then this course is for you!

"Feeling grand about spending my time on two of the most productive and sophisticated areas:

- Adobe Illustrator
- Python

The Illustrator CC MasterClass course has excellent content, well explained and has me feeling confident with the software at the end. Every word uttered is part of the lesson. With that level of focus, it's very easy to follow, learn and remember.

And The Automate the Boring Stuff with Python course was written for people who want to get up to speed writing small programs that do practical tasks as soon as possible. It's also best for beginners to start learning Python language I guess. By the end of this course, you'll be able to write code that not only dramatically increases your productivity, but also be able to list this fun and creative skill on your resume.

"A few months ago, I had gone through a paper on Neural Networks in Structural Health Monitoring and was intrigued by the application of Machine Learning in Structural Analysis and Optimisation. I started digging online for materials that could refine my knowledge and cater to my curiosity on the subject. 

Last Month, I discovered this course  'Introduction to Machine Learning' on Coursera. In addition to providing a Comprehensive Understanding of machine learning models (logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks and natural language processing), it furnsihed hands-on experience implementing the data science models on data sets by implementing machine learning algorithms with PyTorch and open source libraries.

"#16/23 Analyzing Police Activity with pandas | Data Science Career Track | DataCamp
EDA on Stanford Open Policing Project dataset to analyze the impact of gender on police behavior.
Dataset and Python notebook: https://lnkd.in/gvse-ak
pandas cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data.
The following questions were answered.
Does gender affect who gets a ticket for speeding?
Does time of the day affect the arrest rate?
What violations are caught in each district?
How long might you be stopped for a violation?
Does weather arrest the arrest rate?
Does gender affect who is frisked during a search?

"Hello Everybody,
I hope everyone's doing fine! 
I recently built a Telegram bot that provides you statistics on the COVID-19 Count. It generates a report, based on the country of your choice. The search currently supports almost all countries in the world. It also supports a state-wise selection for the countries of the USA, China, Italy, and Australia. The generated report contains statistics and graphical representations that provide a quick analysis of COVID-19 status of your state/country. The data is updated every day from the John Hopkins COVID-19 repository.

Any inputs on this would be highly valued.

You can also view and use the bot at @corona_count_bot on Telegram.

The bot is titled Corona Count.

Here's the third episode of ""Digital Geoscience Data Handling using Python"" series.

Now it's about parsing the EDI Magnetotellurics data format without some dedicated package. Because of how short it was, I added a little processing and inversion using Genetic Algorithm as a twist!

Or visit the Github page here :

I'm not an expert in MT.
Any feedback is welcome. Especially by the MT gurus around the world.
See you in the next one and stay strong.

I got overwhelming deadlines and wisdom teeth problems (I can't even fast) this week. So it got delayed.

"Reliable data is crucial for Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Machine Learning Engineers. If you want to analyze a company, the first step is to find the data from different sources. Now you don't know how reliable and genuine the data is. Even if it is uploaded on Kaggle, it is still uploaded by some XYZ user.

For example, recently I was trying to analyze the worldwide data of coronavirus and I found out that many of the sources were not reliable.

One of the solutions to this problem is Web Scraping. Instead of relying on some random data, you can simply generate your own data from the official websites and that's the primary reason I took this course ""Web Scraping Using Python""

The second reason is the lack of data. We might be familiar with how easy it is to access open-source databases from international companies such as Amazon and Apple. But what if you want to analyze a local company and there is no data available? That's where Web Scraping comes in!

Note: I have found a few glitches in the course, if anyone wishes to learn Web Scrapping from scratch can DM me!

Thank You!
