"While not exactly the most visually impressive, I‚Äôm very proud of this project. There were many firsts for me in this school assignment. The goal was to create a web application using Java Servlets and JSP that allowed the user to add and view information from an Oracle database. This is the first web application I‚Äôve created completely from scratch, database to UI. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve worked with Servlets and JSP. The first time I‚Äôve sent and received data from a database. I‚Äôve learned so much from this project. Seeing the entire process front to back has connected many dots that have previously been a mystery. I‚Äôm excited to take this new knowledge and put it to use creating even more technically impressive applications. While a small victory, I feel very accomplished. üôåüèª

"Social Distancing Analyser
==================

According to WHO, at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between persons are must to reduce the spread of corona virus (COVID-19). To analyse Social distancing in a public places and carry out necessary actions to better deal with the pandemic, I developed a model which can analyse social distancing parameters by detecting distance between two persons.

This is just a demo applied on a small video, I got to learn a lot with this project. Hope you will like it.

"Hi, here is some quick reading - I recently published an article at Better Programming on the theme of developing a workflow for taking algorithms from paper to production.

Link: https://lnkd.in/g9Rf63N

Most real-life problems that we solve, especially as startups, require us to come up with complex logic, manipulating complex datasets, while the solution space itself is often extremely vast. It helps to have these 7 key steps in mind.


Please follow my Medium page for other stories and updates! Do get in touch to discuss anything that piques your interest.

P.S.: I might follow this up with another article going into additional detail in the future.

P.P.S.: Hope you are safe and practising social distancing.

"Even More Python for Beginners: Data Tools by Microsoft

Aspiring data-science and machine-learning developers now have more Microsoft-made free video tutorials to learn how to build software in Python, one of today's most popular and versatile programming languages.

The new More Python for Beginners series consists of 20 videos that run between two minutes and 15 minutes each. It covers working with files, lambdas or 'anonymous functions',

And object-oriented programming and each tutorial are followed by a short demo video. The tutors also introduce some newer functionality to support asynchronous development through async/await.

Nick was working on a problem one day and after some time, after giving some tries he wasn't able to solve it.

"‚ÄúAnnouncing Adobe XD support for Flutter‚Äù by Tim Sneath

We've always dreamt of tools that'd make the development procedures much more easier and fun to work through, finally Adobe XD announced a tool that'll convert some of your XD design to an actual Flutter and dart code!

Of course you can't depend on it to do all the work for you, for instance it doesn't support responsive layouts (as of now), so you might have to work on the layouts after it's generated.

"|| Skye Leahy's Coding Showcase Series: Quarantine Edition ||

I coded a simple Android app using Java that notifies users how many times they have clicked a button.

I developed this app to further instill basic knowledge of app design layout, button functionality, and text input queries. One of the key elements of becoming a good developer is continually reviewing the basics in order to provide a strong foundation upon which to gain higher-level coding skills and techniques.

Have any questions / topics you want to discuss about coding?

"Closures in Javascript are possible because of two things:

1. Functions are first-class citizens. We can pass functions around like data ‚Äî like any other type in Javascript.

2. Lexical scope: Based on where our code is written, the Javascript engine knows before we even run the code what variables each function has access to.

And that's what a closure is ‚Äî a combination of a function and the lexical environment from which it was declared.

Closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or environment even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.

They have two main benefits:
  1. They can be very memory efficient.
  2. They allow us to do Encapsulation.

"Cybercriminals uploaded typosquatted malicious libraries to

According to Tomislav Maljic, threat analyst at ReversingLabs, cybercriminals have been using simple

#typosquatting to carry out their plan ‚Äì which is the process of changing a character or two in a filename or URL in order to fool people into thinking it‚Äôs legitimate. For example, a legitimate file may be called ‚Äúthisisafile.exe,‚Äù while a malicious impersonator may call itself ‚Äúthis1safile.exe.‚Äù Unobservant users could thus download the malicious file by mistake.

Extract the data.
In some cases the data might be available in a readable form, but there are some cases where you need to extract it.
Today, I was trying to use tweepy to extract data, as I wanted to analyse the archive of a popular account.
To gather this data I defined the file - url, request this url and write the content of the response to a separate file.
I will update the analysis once I'm done

"   I've been using many external API's and micro-services in my projects and always wonder about the API architecture and the workflow of it.
      Last week I've decided to enhance the scope of my blogging site BlogBid (CMS) by designing a RESTful API using PHP OOPs concepts with HTTP headers and PDO.
      I tested all the request-response of the API endpoint using Postman API standards & also publish this API on Postman.

"Here is a data definition for measuring time:
(define-struct time (hours minutes))
; A Time is a (make-time Hour Minute)
; interpretation: (make-time h m) is the time  
; expressed in h hours and m minutes
; 
; ‚Äì An Hour is a NaturalNumber between 0 and 11
; ‚Äì A Minute is a NaturalNumber between 0 and 59
Design the function tock, which adds one minute to the given time.

Design the function time->text, which converts a time to a text. The text should look like the display of a common alarm clock, i.e., it should separate the minutes from the hours with a colon. Hint: a text is an image, not a string, but you will need a string version of the time, too. See the HelpDesk for more on the text function.

After you have developed these functions, add a main function, which launches a big-bang program to animate the time.

"Getting stuck on an error is not as bad as you'd think. You get to learn a lot more trying to solve the error than just letting someone else solve it or panicking over it. 

The other day I spent almost 8 hours solving a git push error that occurred due to a new large file in my codebase. 

The error had a wonderful, unexpected outcome: my first technical blog post!

This blog post is here to help some developer out there not spend 8 hours trying to fix the same error. 

Hope it helps someone out there!

"Agarwal Packers and Movers:
Turning Point for their Success
----------------------------------
Ramesh Agarwal was working for Indian Air Force.
After retirement, he founded Agarwal Packers in 1987.
He started his business with door-to-door packaging and later he expanded to warehousing, logistics, and infrastructure.
*
Earlier, Samsung and LG were using other companies for transporting their inventory.
And they were losing 25% of inventory during transit, due to breakage.
When Agarwal started transporting their inventory, the breakage was reduced to 2%.
*
Imagine, for two famous electronics companies, he reduced the breakage from 25% to 2%.
Not an easy task...
Only the committed people can do that!
That was the turning point for Agarwal.
And this is the only packing and moving company which is approved by the Indian Banks  Association.
The revenue of Agarwal Packers and Movers is more than Rs 400 crores.

"Today I learn about new tags in HTML with Pirple.com. It's a sub tag from <div> tag such <header><main> and <footer>.

And today's task is to create web page for our favourite movie/film, so I choose John Wick 3 - Parabellum as My Favourite film.

I create a simple page but actually it's not pure HTML, I add some style sheet with CSS also to make the page more stylish and responsive.

I use 5 tags, it's <video><iframe><audio><form><section>

"I was drawn to programming because I wanted to do something where I could ""make stuff"".  One of my first projects was a memory match game.

With input from a friend, I created a word association game that he could use when he works with kids with special needs.  He just messaged me that the assistant director of his region shared it with her supervisors.  

That was an awesome message to receive, and was only made possible because of the great instructors at LearningFuze!

"*How the smallest of things can bring the biggest changes

Just a week ago, I wrote about how being disciplined helped get through a frustrating week of programming. I code daily and I love it but that week was terrible due to various issues.

In the code editor, you can use different color themes and font styles. I have always stuck to only one font style but I like to change the color theme around every two months.

Yesterday, I got a glimpse of something as small as changing the color theme can drastically change your coding skills.

I was using a light theme from the past 2 months but yesterday I switched it to the dark one. This was the exact theme I used in my toughest project until now. 

That project was delivered a year ago and I have gone sleepless nights to finish the project. As far as I can remember, I have never been that much concentrated on something else before.

I still remember some of the code, issues, and that feeling of focused hard work.

This is the fun part. Somehow that vibe and the theme made a friendly association in my mind and now when I switched back to that theme, I suddenly got into that vibe which resulted in deep work.

"""Entry Control Loop Vs Exit Control Loop""ü§ì

Entry controlled loop is a loop in which the test condition is checked first, and then loop body will be executed. 
It means If the test condition is false, loop body will not be executed.
Ex:- While Loop, For Loop

Exit controlled loop is a loop in which the loop body is executed first and then the given condition is checked afterwards. 
It means If the test condition is false, loop body will still be executed once.
Ex:- Do While Loop

I believe below image is the best example for thisüòä, because the main difference between while and do while is only the starting point, 
But you need to precise that the starting point is the edge in the image.
For more info, kindly check one more image in comment section!üò¨

"Sorry for bursting your bubble guys but your solution isn‚Äôt always optimized as it seems on leetcode runtime distribution.
Or vice-versa.

I submitted my solution, mine solution runtime was showing 256ms and the most optimized one was 196ms.
So I thought of comparing both on my machine.

Guess what? Mine is faster. I tried many times, there is always a large difference in the result.

I guess distribution differs because of submission at different points of time. It runs on different machines at different points of time (runtime varies machine to machine).

So CHILL don‚Äôt bother about the runtime. :p

"Hello, world.
This is Day 10 of 
hashtag
#100DaysOfCode!

Yesterday, I dived deep on adding authentication and authorization to the API. Today, I will be going over the ways in which we can make our flask application more organized when it comes to errors and how to send a proper error message to the user (the client) when things go out of hand. 

While working on this project, I realized that the scale and complexity of the project have increased. What was once a single Python file is now a collection of directories with multiple source code files inside each one. I could only imagine the difficulty a team of software developers will have to face when approaching a complex project without proper documentation. Therefore, working on this small project has taught me that it is best to start documenting your code from an earlier stage; don't procrastinate on giving a few lines of comments on your code. Because when the size of the project becomes bigger and more individuals come together to work as a team, the harder it'll be to fully understand its systematic flow.

Remember: stay consistent!

"Took my first baby step in the field of Data Science. I found the course provided by Microsoft really interesting! Learnt about Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas which are great tools to begin with! The user friendly interface of EDX is a great to work on! Along with this the intuitive sessions on DataCamp provide amazing learning experience! 
Looking forward to learn more!
I would really appreciate some recommendations regarding what should I do next in this field!

"Learning a new language is fun. But developing a whole new language is challenging as well as exciting. As a part of my coursework, I have developed this new language Decaf20. It is more similar and simpler version of C, developed in python. The library I have used is PLY.lexer, only for the lexical analysis part. Further work can be done on code optimization, especially for the machine code generation part. I am really happy to share this!

#coursera .This course was is so good that I ended up completing this 6 week course within a week. This course developed my problem solving skills and also built a strong foundation in

#python. It taught me to work with lists, dictionaries and strings in python. Lastly , as my final project I built a word cloud in python using all the concepts I learnt. The practice quizzes were challenging and the way the instructors explained was very easy to comprehend. I was a beginner who did not even have the basic idea of python syntax and I ended up feeling confident about the basics of python. This course got me interested in programming and I hope to develop my skills further."

"Threats come from all areas, from malware attacks to compromised user credentials, and even accidental data leaks caused by human error. Naturally, it follows that an effective security system should have tools to cover all these areas.

Using tools like Azure Active Directory and Single Sign On, you can protect your system from common user credential problems while Azure Information Protection can keep your data encrypted and secure even if it's shared outside of your system.

We the Cyber-security team at Sahara Net understand the security problems facing your business are far from simple, which is why our multifaceted solution contains tools to address each one.

"Let's be honest, securing our patient's data records isn't typically the first thing on our mind when we walk into work each day. It's the ""important, but not urgent"" item, that continues to get pushed back to a later date.

But for healthcare professionals, waiting too long to get serious about cybersecurity, could cost you... big time.

In our recent blog post, we discuss some simple ways to start securing your data, train your team on cybersecurity, and prevent future breaches. In the midst COVID-19, knowing that precious patient information is secure will give you the peace of mind you need to do your job well.

"Hello Folks,

Hope you are doing well.

Being an Android developer, I know that technologies are changing very rapidly now a days. After Android SDK, Flutter provides a strong and better environment for us to create amazing apps. I have started learning Flutter few months ago by myself.

Few of my friends/colleague approached me as they find a lot of trouble to understand the concepts of Flutter SDK from Basic to advance level.

Instead of helping them individually I have created an application that will help everyone to understand all of Flutter features easily.

This application have all the required information in detail which you would need while working on Flutter environment.

I am open to any suggestion that can make this application more valuable to you all.

"Looking to learn Nodejs?

How about starting by learning the following 5 things?

1. The Javascript standard ECMAScript: learning this will help you understand what JS features are supported in your Nodejs version and what is not. 
2. The languages in which you can write Nodejs applications. Namely Javascript or Typescript.
3. The Observer pattern, as Nodejs applications heavily rely on this design pattern.
4. The Callback pattern which supplements the Observer pattern in carrying out executions.
5. Basics of the V8 engine and how it executes the Javascript code that you write. It's important not to go too deep into this has it can be quite complex to understand at first.

"Recently I had some free time caused by the pandemic. So I decided to learn something new... 
hashtag
#Programming!

As a complete beginner in development, I did some research and found 
hashtag
#Flutter!  Flutter is Google‚Äôs UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for 
hashtag
#mobile, 
hashtag
#web, and 
hashtag
#desktop from a single codebase. 

Amazing, isn't it? Moreover, Google sponsored free sections of the course ""Flutter Development Bootcamp"" from the The App Brewery. Afterward, I decided to buy the rest of the course and worked myself through it. 

Following several weeks of intense learning, struggling and continuous practice, I am now officially able to develop stunning iOS and Android Apps with 
hashtag
#Dart on Flutter :) 

Big applause for Angela Yu, my teacher on Udemy. You made the course funny, interactive and I learned a lot about programming-concepts and the overall development process."

"                                                HTML
The full meaning of HTML is Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 

                             WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH HTML
1. You can publish documents online with text 
2. You can store data in the user's web browser and access later.
3. You can create forms to collect user inputs like names, e-mail address, comments, etc.
4. You can create lists and sub lists.

The code written below consists of elements, lists, tags, headings, paragraphs, etc.
The aim of the code is to explain to us what we see on the front end of a website. It shows us how the codes are put together, where the tags are needed, the essence of some tags such as <br>, <p>, <li>, <ul>, <ol>, <head>, <body> etc. What happens when you open a tag without closing it etc.

This code was written to make a list of things to do when cooking beans.

The code consists of two lists namely;
1. Unordered list.
2. Ordered list.

The unordered list consists of the list of all the ingredients needed to make beans.
The ordered list consists of the detailed steps needed to prepare beans.

"üíª Data Structures and Algo - Day 1:

What are Data Structures? They are nothing but a bunch of Uhaul boxes, movers, trucks and storage units trapped in a computer. 

All we are doing is to define, move, manipulate and manage these boxes. They often move from one place to another. Data is a nomad.

The simple logic is: first, we define a data structure (i.e. Uhaul medium box), then, organize/manipulate the data (i.e. insert your office supplies in the box), then return the data (your Uhaul box is ready to go). 

Insert, search, remove are sample examples of operations we can perform on data structures (after you think you packed all the office supplies, you find a keyboard laying around, and you open the Uhaul box to insert it). The type of the data structure (i.e. Uhaul box), will define what operations we can do with it. Not all are the same. There are also relationships between data structures, for example: kitchen related Uhaul boxes all belong to ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù,  office related Uhaul boxes all belong to ‚Äúoffice‚Äù etc.  

*U-Haul is an American moving equipment and storage rental company.

Can you think of a data structure from a daily life?
