#A great lesson to learn from one of the worlds best companies , General Electric for mid sized firms are :

1- In planning the"" middle ""is gone. We only have to define 2 points : where we plan to be 10 to 25

#years from now , and what we have to do in next 90 days . The 90 days point requires real time data and an executive team that can face the brutal reality of what the

2- Keep everything stupidly simple . If our strategies , plans , decisions ,

"I get uneasy whenever I am returning something...from Amazon or any other retailer.

Because I see that reverse logistics (since it does not add to the revenue) is extremely neglected from an operational efficiency aspect.

So as someone passionate about operational efficiency, I rant everytime I am returning something 😑

So here is my latest rant about reverse logistics...and of course with some suggestions on how we can leverage analytics to solve for the problem.

The solution suggested in this video is parcel network backhaul optimization.

Extremely challenging but not impossible...for someone with Amazon's data infrastructure...since nearly real time visibility, immaculately maintained packaging and delivery asset volume data, and a high level of accuracy of many other types of data that will be leveraged, is the key to solve it.

Organizations currently have a multitude of other problems to solve for but few years from now, they should look into reverse logistics. It is attractive not only from $$$ aspect but sustainability angel is also very important.

Side note: If you are thinking why I got the weird haircut I am sporting in this video...it is a result of trying to cut my hair myself. 😁

"As I was writing my 
hashtag
#newbook on 
hashtag
#datastorytelling, I had an interesting epiphany—data storytellers are change agents. Whenever we discover a new insight, the natural consequence of that insight is change. Stop doing that, and do more of this. Focus less on them, and concentrate more on these people. Spend less there, and invest more over here.

In our excitement to share our insights, we forget we're inviting change. There will always be resistance to change—even if it’s for the better. Author Dan Millman said, “The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.” Rather than trying to destroy the pre-existing narrative in our audience’s minds that may be based on outdated, incomplete, or erroneous data, we need to build a new narrative with our new insights. If you’ve read my book already, you know I place a lot of emphasis on driving action with insights. Data storytellers need to anticipate the resistance their insights will encounter. If we can craft our data stories more effectively, we can help mitigate and overcome this resistance to change.

Excel can execute linear regression, ETS Forecast, ARIMA Forecast, even can transfer the working calculation behind Prophet Forecast to do it in excel. What's more ? Simple Machine Learning technique such as Decision Tree , Bayes and  kNN works like charms too.

and I do not try this yet - BERT toolkit ( https://bert-toolkit.com/) enable Excel wizard to load R Library and function to use it within Excel function. wow ! imagine I can test out some R algorithm in excel before completely build reproducible data product in R. ~ different datasets needs different treatment ~. The purpose of this to see how well the model fits into Business Operation / Domain.

Business Domain Knowledge must come first before any statistical technique.

If you got large datasets  - you can load to Excel Power Query / connect to your database / ETL tools. 

Dont forget about VBA, m code and DAX in excel too !

I found there is a bit of hand holding with this project as some of the code was already filled out (much like with the examples in the lectures)

Maybe they become more free form with more advanced topics??

What I did enjoy about this project is it gives you more exposure to typing out code so you can build that muscle memory 💪🏻🧠⌨

Today I was working on a Bike share dataset.
I tried to clean and analyze the dataset.
Some of the questions I took to analyze are:
1. In which areas are the business established. 
2. Which time the usage of the service is more? 
3. What type of users are using the service. 
4. In which days the demands is high? 

Will continue to analyze the dataset and share the results here.

"Anyone else glad they aren't graduating in 2020?

I feel sorry for the graduates, and I have no fake advice to give. The market is worse than 9/11 and more than likely, you have no experience. 

But stick with it. Hope for the best and prep for the worse. If it's prolonged, realize that last in first out is real and don't get happy on your first salary and buy things. Save instead. 

Be flexible. If you have LinkedIn premium, you'll see a lot of post with 400+ applicants. Hold out for your dream job if you want, just realize that the life cycle to landing your first job is longer.

However, the recent F5 report shows that 66% of EMEA organisations are concerned with the lack of skilled security staff to support the increasing adoption of multi-cloud.

It's true that martech delivers a universe of data that would have been considered unbelievable a decade ago. Many marketers have a dashboard for that data. 

The problem is that while crucial,

#Data is a static measurement that says ""this happened or didn't happen during this timeframe and at this place.""  It intrinsically lacks connection to anything else.
