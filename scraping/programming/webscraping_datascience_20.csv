"Our lives have been largely data driven. We like to take ""informed"" decisions. With COVID-19 around, data-driven decision making has only become even more prominent. An interesting topic that I discuss in my ""Big Data"" class is ""Data Models"". To represent data, there are several ways. These form the basis for DBMS (Database Management Systems - the software that helps you add/modify/delete/maintain data). One of the prominent ways is ""Property Graph Models"". Their applications are plenty. One of the applications is ""Knowledge Graph"".
The key question is, given that we have so much of social media, wikipedia and other data around us, what do we know about COVID-19? Researchers have quickly put together a COVID-19 knowledge graph. See https://lnkd.in/gCDKhCz.

"You may have asked yourself this question before: What kind of data analyst am I? Or how do my strengths fall into the emerging technologies of 2020? 

We are living in the future by the way. Data is power and you are the oracle. It’s very common and important to do a bit of self reflection and see what type of analyst you are in this data landscape. With the introduction of no-code machine learning, the type of analyst you are might have changed a bit.

Maybe you’re a Data Wrangler, or Innovator, Communicator, or the Machine Learning Mastermind.

The only way to know is to take our short quiz and find out!

I just finished my first one: TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game

This project allows you to apply the skills learned in the Intermediate Python course >>

-Matplotlib
-Dictionaries & Pandas
-Logic, Control Flow & Filtering

I found there is a bit of hand holding with this project as some of the code was already filled out (much like with the examples in the lectures)

Maybe they become more free form with more advanced topics??

What I did enjoy about this project is it gives you more exposure to typing out code so you can build that muscle memory 💪🏻🧠⌨

"Dear Data Scientists and Biostatisticians. I was preparing for this topic for a long time, seeing over and over how you are taught things that harm the science (and your reputation).

I'm gonna show you why the context-less outlier detection methods proposed practically everywhere, are almost useless, and why t̲h̲o̲u̲g̲h̲t̲l̲e̲s̲s̲ removal of outliers, instead of embracing and LEARNING from them, is so wrong.

After reading the attached document, you should be able to understand why people, who remove outliers blindly, without attempting to investigate it and who don't even try to learn the context, either completely don't understand what they do, don't care, or they lie intentionally.

Don't be an ignoramus, don't lie, investigate both missing data and outliers.

Outliers? I'll show you cases, where the truly worrying data aren't even visible.

❗autonomous AI, electronic engineering may need automated detection and removal (it may indicate need for shielding, filters, clipping).

"Change in human behavior during the pandemic is affecting AI models --During the pandemic the world changed, people's behavior changed, and the data changed. ML models that were trained on normal human behavior run behind the scenes in inventory management, fraud detection, investing, marketing, recommendations, and more. ML models are designed to respond to changes but they perform badly when input data differs too much from the data they were trained on. In general, if a ML system doesn’t see what it’s expecting to see, then you will have problems and many businesses that use ML systems lack the expertise required to maintain them.

I am happy to share with you all that I’d successfully completed the

#Coursera. I am sharing here my experiences, learning and realizations from this course.

1) With courses 1, 2 & 3 I’d learnt how to approach, optimize models, minimize errors and try to solve any real life problms.

2) Maths is very imp for doing EDA, Feature Engg, Optimizing  models e.g if one understands how back-prop and gradient descent works mathematically then it is easy to learn any Neural Nets. Here we can see actual implementation of maths in solving real world problms.

3) Courses 4 & 5 have detailed explanations of various state of the art DL algos. It explains How to use, When to use, What purpose we are solving and What are the limitations of these algos. It is very imp to realize this before using any algos.

4) Implementation of simple models without using libraries, provides better understanding of complex models, in finding errors and improving model.

5) The best way of learning is through solving assignmnts, practicing on problms from platform like 
hashtag
#kaggle.

6) One should be updated and try to learn and improve everyday.

so here's my take. As far as I can tell, no work has been published to date that provides a similar comprehensive comparison.

TL;DR - I fit cumulative case data to 7 different mathematical functions and found that the Richards model, an asymmetric logistic growth curve, worked best.

"Post - DS4
Data
When talking data science, data is the first thing that should come up. We'll be working upon and investing entire time on it. Here are some traits about data.
1) Structured or Unstructured - Structured data is well represented into a fix schema eg. databases, excels etc. Working on it is easier as it makes more comprehensible. Unstructured data has no specific form, from a file on the drive to a physical document anything . It is converted into structured format first.
2)Quantitative and Categorical - Quantitative data is a measurable value telling the degree of a object. Categorical data tells about a properties, it can't be measured. It is a good practice to encode such data into numeric representations.
3)Big or Little - This is in terms with scale of data, usually the larger data we obtain better it is as it has less chances of missing any case. It can also be sampled to a smaller data set if required. A small data set on the other hand takes less time to analyse, takes less computing resources and easier to perform. Scale of data should be controlled problem to problem, for example if analysing voters mood in a constituency one can use a poll of 100-500 individuals rather than going on Social media and analyse all the posts and trends.

"Data scientists when they spend 3 days training their neural network but it performs 5% worse than random 🤪🤪

It really do be like that sometimes....

However - you can minimise this risk by deploying Occam's razor or The Law of Parsimony which states - ""entities should not be multiplied without necessity"" or more simply ""the simple solution is often the best one""

Start your machine learning tasks with some basic baselines and analysis so you can setup experiments to evaluate the gain for each incremental change in your modelling decisions or architecture. This is where the science aspect comes in handy!

Be wary of any assumptions you make in the process, more often than not - something simple and seemingly banal which you overlook, is THE difference between success and failure, especially when you need to deploy your final solution into a maze of production systems.

Simple is not the devil - the devil is in the details!

Happy machine learning - may all of your models train quickly and return great results this week! 🙌🙌🙌

"*Read if anyone wants to do a short project using Spotify's data!*

I haven't shared content in a while. After rescinded offers and canceled interviews, I took a short break from my job search.
In that time, I focused on personal growth and exploring new hobbies.

Now that I am getting back to work, I feel rejuvenated and more enthusiastic about the search!

While I'll be sharing stuff again now, I have a few updates:
Some of you showed interest in my Analysis of Eminem's Album Trends (I'll link it in comments).
So, I have updated my GitHub with the code for my analysis. This code has a step-by-step explanation of accessing Spotify's APIs, writing Python scripts to automate HTTP requests, and formatting the data given by Spotify.

https://lnkd.in/gGs5gS6

If anyone wants to do a short project, you can use this code to get the data. You can do similar analyses for your favorite artists as well!
Feel free to reach out to me in case you need any inspiration or want to collaborate. I'd also love to hear from you if you use this code to do any project!

"Forecasting QLD public transport usage (pre COVID-19)

This post summarises some work I was conducting into determining ""what is the best statistical forecasting method for QLD transport data"" prior to COVID-19 social distancing.

The process of model comparison so far has been quite interesting, and has really highlighted that sometimes the most complex model isn't the best model for the job. Indeed, it can sometimes be useful to build some simpler models first, as I have done here, so you have a performance benchmark in addition to the usual residuals and test data accuracy.

Very keen to get back into this in the near future and work to build in some COVID-19 impacts."

"Throughout both college and my internships, my goal has been to gain as many career skills as possible.  From WIU, I have learned the foundation of supply chain management.  I have gained real-life experience in projects related to data manipulation, data visualization and analysis, and project management at both Nestle Waters and CAT.  Now wrapping up a semester of the WIU MBA program with a 4.0, I have gained another skill. The newest addition to my arsenal is Python.  I am thrilled to have completed a real world statistics project utilizing python to analyze the impacts of various factors on test scores in public schools.  With the skills gained throughout the past 4.5 years, I am very confident I will be able to make an impact on any business I join after graduating in the fall!
