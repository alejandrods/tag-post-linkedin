"Remember, that T9 dictionary??
Even on those feature phones with practically negligible space, compared to what we have today... How they were able to search so fast over a million words.

As a kid that amazed me so much. I never thought a simple data structure made it all possible.

Name of the data structure - TRIE
 
Today I learned what literally effects and optimizes our search daily. 
The google instant search suggestions. Yes, they are all TRIE.

 This one is too good to be missed.

"Recently, I was fortunate to take part in a 2 day Introduction to Coding Webinar with TAPintoTech and SEO London .

It was an enjoyable, interactive session where I used Python to create a login system. In particular, it was interesting to learn about the use of Python in the world of finance, such as algorithmic trading. Overall, it was a great experience to broaden my knowledge in coding.

Thank you for a wonderful session, I look forward to building upon what I have learnt!

"I was already starting to learn python on my own when I noticed a post saying that https://lnkd.in/gTEn8fE  provides python courses and helps to set the building blocks of a career in Data Science. I checked it out and finished the introductory course which covered the basic syntax and Numpy library functionalities, in addition to some statistical exercises. I started the Data Science Courses enrollment as well, hoping to get further knowledge in this domain.

"Autonomous Medical Coding- 

I have never been a committed supporter of Computer Assisted Coding due to real concerns with coding accuracy and the inordinate amount of time for the system to adapt and become productive and useful for the hospital that implements CAC. About a year ago I had the opportunity to see Nym's autonomous coding solution in action at a hospital site and was really impressed by its functionality and accuracy in code assignment. 

I highly encourage you to register and check out this coding solution for yourself on May 19th. Worth looking at as an alternative to CAC.

"Thanks! Leading India AI for this opportunity. The course was relatively simple. Though its pretty surprising that you don't really need to be an expert in Deep learning in order to create an efficient DL model. 
The concept of optimizing available similar Dl models to your own problem statement by training selective layers and not getting a significant degradation in performance was a huge shocker to me !
Not only this give you a relatively well trained model but also helps you save resources (Time, Data, Computation-Power, etc)

<<Check 1st comment for details>>

We created WhatsApp groups few months back but there were people with diverse seniority levels and interests in each group.

Because of this we could not share many resources as something relevant to a student might not have been relevant to a senior folk and vice versa.
---

We're finally moving to slack so that people can join channels based on their interest.

I encourage you to join and start healthy discussions in the topic of your interest. üòÉ

Happy learning!

Please share this with people who might benefit from joining the channels.

"Based on what other nations are experiencing at this moment, we must be prepared for second, third, and fourth waves of this infection. 

Unfortunately, beating this disease is harder than most would think. For us to beat it, we must first be sufficiently scared of it - it could happen to you, or anyone in your family. 

Then comes the necessity of good hygiene and proper precautions against this virus. These are a must if we have to break the chain of transmission and thus flatten the curve.

And finally here is something which must not be missed - the only defence you have against a viral disease is your immune system. Doctors and medicines are also only helping the immune system do its job. The vaccine also only serve as a learning experience for the immune system.

Thus it is very important that one and all maintain their health. Eat good food, get good exercise, and stay sane.

"Today's 
hashtag
#SmoothstackSpotlight is on Rufat Aghayev!

Growing up, 
hashtag
#softwareengineering was not one of Rufat‚Äôs dreams or aspirations. He longed to become a TV host, and actually worked in 
hashtag
#entertainment for several years as a TV and radio host for the #1 network in Azerbaijan (ATV) hosting talk shows, music contests, and radio shows. He always enjoyed exploring new cultures and cities, however it wasn‚Äôt until he visited NYC for a work trip that he considered a permanent move.

Rufat was looking for a new creative outlet, and realized the 
hashtag
#tech industry was a rapidly changing field of opportunity, and in 2018, he moved to NYC to study 
hashtag
#computerscience at Flatiron School. From there he joined Smoothstack's 
hashtag
#apprenticeship where he decided he wanted to be a resource to his fellow students and accepted a TA position.

‚ÄúOne thing that makes Smoothstack really special is how the curriculum is determined by the client on day one... ensuring we add value to organizations as soon as we start.

My background as a host makes me very comfortable leading a group of students. I think it‚Äôs important to show you can be confident in this environment when there‚Äôs this expectation that you‚Äôre working alone behind a computer all day.‚Äù

Thank you, Rufat!

"Even More Python for Beginners: Data Tools by Microsoft

Aspiring data-science and machine-learning developers now have more Microsoft-made free video tutorials to learn how to build software in Python, one of today's most popular and versatile programming languages.

The new More Python for Beginners series consists of 20 videos that run between two minutes and 15 minutes each. It covers working with files, lambdas or 'anonymous functions',

And object-oriented programming and each tutorial are followed by a short demo video. The tutors also introduce some newer functionality to support asynchronous development through async/await.

"Sorry for bursting your bubble guys but your solution isn‚Äôt always optimized as it seems on leetcode runtime distribution.
Or vice-versa.

I submitted my solution, mine solution runtime was showing 256ms and the most optimized one was 196ms.
So I thought of comparing both on my machine.

Guess what? Mine is faster. I tried many times, there is always a large difference in the result.

I guess distribution differs because of submission at different points of time. It runs on different machines at different points of time (runtime varies machine to machine).

So CHILL don‚Äôt bother about the runtime. :p

"Social Distancing Analyser
==================

According to WHO, at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between persons are must to reduce the spread of corona virus (COVID-19). To analyse Social distancing in a public places and carry out necessary actions to better deal with the pandemic, I developed a model which can analyse social distancing parameters by detecting distance between two persons.

This is just a demo applied on a small video, I got to learn a lot with this project. Hope you will like it.

"Here‚Äôs my little humble story to hopefully inspire you for the upcoming week!

I was born into poverty where clean water was a luxury. But ever since I could remember, I‚Äôve always known that I could be and do whatever I set my mind to.

I struggled with self-worth after loosing my parents. I thought doing good in school would boost my worthiness and be more significant to the people around me, which I craved. I would skip lunch to study, taking night classes (most of the time I would pay for the classes with the money I earned from recycling because I didn‚Äôt wanted to bother my aunt). Hard work definitely pays off, I was one the highest ranked in class for 6 straight years.

I call them out by typing their name (yes, they understand full-text search). Quite flexible and can happily fit in any sort of space - exactly, they're responsive! 

It's just amazing how a few lines of code can build such a pretty cool app. If you want to play with my Robofriends, find them here https://lnkd.in/gHYzKpF and have fun. :)

"Learning a new language is fun. But developing a whole new language is challenging as well as exciting. As a part of my coursework, I have developed this new language Decaf20. It is more similar and simpler version of C, developed in python. The library I have used is PLY.lexer, only for the lexical analysis part. Further work can be done on code optimization, especially for the machine code generation part. I am really happy to share this!

Before we analyse the data the main thing that we must do is
Extract the data.
In some cases the data might be available in a readable form, but there are some cases where you need to extract it.
Today, I was trying to use tweepy to extract data, as I wanted to analyse the archive of a popular account.
To gather this data I defined the file - url, request this url and write the content of the response to a separate file.
I will update the analysis once I'm done

"Greetings to All!

I am happy to see a good response for my last post on NumPy. This 100-day programming challenge has taught me a lot.

Today's topic is, advance Numpy where I will be discussing broadcasting, fancy indexing, and multithreading.

Attached is my GitHub repo and I am happy to share this. I was first sceptical about learning these topics. But later I understood with consistent focused effort, we can learn anything. 
Remember a famous quote ""Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it - Albert Einstein""

Once again, thank you all for your support. See you in my next post. Have a safe day!

"Week 5 of coding bootcamp is kind of blowing my mind.  The concepts we've been studying so far in Java have had steady expansions with each week, but I feel like the leap into object oriented programming has more significance.  Though my understanding as I to go through the lessons hasn't been without speed bumps, I think I'm following with enough clarity.  In sum, I feel like I'm seeing a powerful potential with OOP that  has a lot of weight to it over the previous weeks' material.

Today's problem solving question was based on the need to understand the use of conditional statements.Implemented the solution in three different languages -Java, Python and Cpp.

Also I was delighted to attend a webinar on ""Managing Projects with Git and GitHub"" hosted by Ajit Panigrahi. 

It helped me understand the need to use Git,difference between Git and GitHub.Few basic commands and much more.

"I started my first job out of college in January. In March, my company went full WFH. It has been an interesting experience so far - I feel that I perform better in-person, finding it easier to ask questions and learn from my teammates. Long story short - it has been a little rough.

I decided to start an online community to help other people in tech like me, who are trying to adjust to work life during shelter-in-place and coronavirus. This community will be for anything from venting, to advice, to job openings.

Please, feel free to join at https://discord.gg/CPjWYM - everyone is welcome!

I'd become fed up with the long hours in front of the monitor, the ""nerd status"", and the buggy lines of unmaintained code that littered the industry.

Your first VIDEO will be awful.
Your first ARTICLE will be awful.
Your first ART will be awful.
Your first PHOTO will be awful.

But, your first CODE will be perfect.
Zero bugs and a very clean code.

It will be ""Hello World!""

"we need to type macchanger, options and then the device.
Now in order to check out our available options, we can type here, as it says, try macchanger
--help.
So we will type macchanger --help and it will basically show us right here some of the available
options that we can use. Right now, in order to find out what our mac address is,
we want to use this option, which is --show or -s.
Now if we just type here macchanger -s, it will say that we incorrectly used this program because
we didn't specify the device.
Now this device basically means your network interface card. You might be having multiple interface cards
so we want to pick one. If you type here
ifconfig, as we covered in the previous tutorials,
it will print you up with your network interfaces. Right here
I only have the LOOPBACK interface
and the eth0 interface, which I use to connect to the Internet.

"Someone recently said it is a good measure of a company not how they behave when times are good, but when times are tough. QA is doing the right thing to support those who are furloughed or have been made redundant at a difficult time globally for many companies, an opportunity to upskill or reskill individuals through free live training with world class trainers. If you know someone affected please point them in our direction."

"üíª Data Structures and Algo - Day 1:

What are Data Structures? They are nothing but a bunch of Uhaul boxes, movers, trucks and storage units trapped in a computer. 

All we are doing is to define, move, manipulate and manage these boxes. They often move from one place to another. Data is a nomad.

The simple logic is: first, we define a data structure (i.e. Uhaul medium box), then, organize/manipulate the data (i.e. insert your office supplies in the box), then return the data (your Uhaul box is ready to go). 

Insert, search, remove are sample examples of operations we can perform on data structures (after you think you packed all the office supplies, you find a keyboard laying around, and you open the Uhaul box to insert it). The type of the data structure (i.e. Uhaul box), will define what operations we can do with it. Not all are the same. There are also relationships between data structures, for example: kitchen related Uhaul boxes all belong to ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù,  office related Uhaul boxes all belong to ‚Äúoffice‚Äù etc.  

*U-Haul is an American moving equipment and storage rental company.

Can you think of a data structure from a daily life?
