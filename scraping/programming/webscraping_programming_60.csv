"Even More Python for Beginners: Data Tools by Microsoft

Aspiring data-science and machine-learning developers now have more Microsoft-made free video tutorials to learn how to build software in Python, one of today's most popular and versatile programming languages.

The new More Python for Beginners series consists of 20 videos that run between two minutes and 15 minutes each. It covers working with files, lambdas or 'anonymous functions',

And object-oriented programming and each tutorial are followed by a short demo video. The tutors also introduce some newer functionality to support asynchronous development through async/await.

"Here is a data definition for measuring time:
(define-struct time (hours minutes))
; A Time is a (make-time Hour Minute)
; interpretation: (make-time h m) is the time  
; expressed in h hours and m minutes
; 
; – An Hour is a NaturalNumber between 0 and 11
; – A Minute is a NaturalNumber between 0 and 59
Design the function tock, which adds one minute to the given time.

Design the function time->text, which converts a time to a text. The text should look like the display of a common alarm clock, i.e., it should separate the minutes from the hours with a colon. Hint: a text is an image, not a string, but you will need a string version of the time, too. See the HelpDesk for more on the text function.

After you have developed these functions, add a main function, which launches a big-bang program to animate the time.

"*How the smallest of things can bring the biggest changes

Just a week ago, I wrote about how being disciplined helped get through a frustrating week of programming. I code daily and I love it but that week was terrible due to various issues.

In the code editor, you can use different color themes and font styles. I have always stuck to only one font style but I like to change the color theme around every two months.

Yesterday, I got a glimpse of something as small as changing the color theme can drastically change your coding skills.

I was using a light theme from the past 2 months but yesterday I switched it to the dark one. This was the exact theme I used in my toughest project until now. 

That project was delivered a year ago and I have gone sleepless nights to finish the project. As far as I can remember, I have never been that much concentrated on something else before.

I still remember some of the code, issues, and that feeling of focused hard work.

This is the fun part. Somehow that vibe and the theme made a friendly association in my mind and now when I switched back to that theme, I suddenly got into that vibe which resulted in deep work.

"While not exactly the most visually impressive, I’m very proud of this project. There were many firsts for me in this school assignment. The goal was to create a web application using Java Servlets and JSP that allowed the user to add and view information from an Oracle database. This is the first web application I’ve created completely from scratch, database to UI. It’s the first time I’ve worked with Servlets and JSP. The first time I’ve sent and received data from a database. I’ve learned so much from this project. Seeing the entire process front to back has connected many dots that have previously been a mystery. I’m excited to take this new knowledge and put it to use creating even more technically impressive applications. While a small victory, I feel very accomplished. 🙌🏻

"Several years ago, I found myself disillusioned with software engineering, so I explored a career shift.  I'd become fed up with the long hours in front of the monitor, the ""nerd status"", and the buggy lines of unmaintained code that littered the industry.  It seems sooner or later, every programmer faces a question of whether to continue coding or explore another path...

"Getting stuck on an error is not as bad as you'd think. You get to learn a lot more trying to solve the error than just letting someone else solve it or panicking over it. 

The other day I spent almost 8 hours solving a git push error that occurred due to a new large file in my codebase. 

The error had a wonderful, unexpected outcome: my first technical blog post!

This blog post is here to help some developer out there not spend 8 hours trying to fix the same error. 

Hope it helps someone out there!

"Agarwal Packers and Movers:
Turning Point for their Success
----------------------------------
Ramesh Agarwal was working for Indian Air Force.
After retirement, he founded Agarwal Packers in 1987.
He started his business with door-to-door packaging and later he expanded to warehousing, logistics, and infrastructure.
*
Earlier, Samsung and LG were using other companies for transporting their inventory.
And they were losing 25% of inventory during transit, due to breakage.
When Agarwal started transporting their inventory, the breakage was reduced to 2%.
*
Imagine, for two famous electronics companies, he reduced the breakage from 25% to 2%.
Not an easy task...
Only the committed people can do that!
That was the turning point for Agarwal.
And this is the only packing and moving company which is approved by the Indian Banks  Association.
The revenue of Agarwal Packers and Movers is more than Rs 400 crores.

"What is the concurrent mode in react?


React is continuously adding new powerful features to its core API’s and speedily adapting to a better way of programming. Last time the react team came up with the hooks which are a cool and smart feature for functional programming. Now its time for introducing concurrency in react!
So what is concurrency at all?
If you start searching in google you can see thousands of examples and definitions for concurrency in computer-science, many of them play around with the classical dining philosopher problem. But in our case react is going to solve a very simple problem that modern JavaScript libraries haven’t addressed yet.
The non-blocking rendering
Typically the modern UI libraries do not support interrupting the rendering process. This is called the blocking rendering, now react is going to make it non-blocking. That is the rendering is Interruptible.

"                                                HTML
The full meaning of HTML is Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 

                             WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH HTML
1. You can publish documents online with text 
2. You can store data in the user's web browser and access later.
3. You can create forms to collect user inputs like names, e-mail address, comments, etc.
4. You can create lists and sub lists.

The code written below consists of elements, lists, tags, headings, paragraphs, etc.
The aim of the code is to explain to us what we see on the front end of a website. It shows us how the codes are put together, where the tags are needed, the essence of some tags such as <br>, <p>, <li>, <ul>, <ol>, <head>, <body> etc. What happens when you open a tag without closing it etc.

This code was written to make a list of things to do when cooking beans.

The code consists of two lists namely;
1. Unordered list.
2. Ordered list.

The unordered list consists of the list of all the ingredients needed to make beans.
The ordered list consists of the detailed steps needed to prepare beans.

Before we analyse the data the main thing that we must do is
Extract the data.
In some cases the data might be available in a readable form, but there are some cases where you need to extract it.
Today, I was trying to use tweepy to extract data, as I wanted to analyse the archive of a popular account.
To gather this data I defined the file - url, request this url and write the content of the response to a separate file.
I will update the analysis once I'm done

"“Announcing Adobe XD support for Flutter” by Tim Sneath

We've always dreamt of tools that'd make the development procedures much more easier and fun to work through, finally Adobe XD announced a tool that'll convert some of your XD design to an actual Flutter and dart code!

Of course you can't depend on it to do all the work for you, for instance it doesn't support responsive layouts (as of now), so you might have to work on the layouts after it's generated.

"Learning a new language is fun. But developing a whole new language is challenging as well as exciting. As a part of my coursework, I have developed this new language Decaf20. It is more similar and simpler version of C, developed in python. The library I have used is PLY.lexer, only for the lexical analysis part. Further work can be done on code optimization, especially for the machine code generation part. I am really happy to share this!

Hi guys, just on this lockdown time I've decided to study some online courses. Finally found one ""Pirple.com"" which teaches HTML and CSS for free with certification. The course is awesome and easy to understand. From the fundamental class, I've written an HTML code for preparing food, which is eventually my homework. Kindly look at it..!!!!

"I was bored during this lockdown period and did not have anything to do. So, I decided to be productive by learning a new 
hashtag
#programming language. I came across this course offered by 
hashtag
#Google on 
hashtag
#coursera .This course was is so good that I ended up completing this 6 week course within a week. This course developed my problem solving skills and also built a strong foundation in 
hashtag
#python. It taught me to work with lists, dictionaries and strings in python. Lastly , as my final project I built a word cloud in python using all the concepts I learnt. The practice quizzes were challenging and the way the instructors explained was very easy to comprehend. I was a beginner who did not even have the basic idea of python syntax and I ended up feeling confident about the basics of python. This course got me interested in programming and I hope to develop my skills further."

"I was drawn to programming because I wanted to do something where I could ""make stuff"".  One of my first projects was a memory match game.

With input from a friend, I created a word association game that he could use when he works with kids with special needs.  He just messaged me that the assistant director of his region shared it with her supervisors.  

That was an awesome message to receive, and was only made possible because of the great instructors at LearningFuze!

"Nick is very good at programming.
Nick was working on a problem one day and after some time, after giving some tries he wasn't able to solve it.

He then went to his friend and said, ""this problem is very difficult and I am not able to solve it, what should I do?""

Nick's friend has briefly described what one should do when they face a very difficult problem. Do, give it a read.

"Sorry for bursting your bubble guys but your solution isn’t always optimized as it seems on leetcode runtime distribution.
Or vice-versa.

I submitted my solution, mine solution runtime was showing 256ms and the most optimized one was 196ms.
So I thought of comparing both on my machine.

Guess what? Mine is faster. I tried many times, there is always a large difference in the result.

I guess distribution differs because of submission at different points of time. It runs on different machines at different points of time (runtime varies machine to machine).

So CHILL don’t bother about the runtime. :p

"we need to type macchanger, options and then the device.
Now in order to check out our available options, we can type here, as it says, try macchanger
--help.
So we will type macchanger --help and it will basically show us right here some of the available
options that we can use. Right now, in order to find out what our mac address is,
we want to use this option, which is --show or -s.
Now if we just type here macchanger -s, it will say that we incorrectly used this program because
we didn't specify the device.
Now this device basically means your network interface card. You might be having multiple interface cards
so we want to pick one. If you type here
ifconfig, as we covered in the previous tutorials,
it will print you up with your network interfaces. Right here
I only have the LOOPBACK interface
and the eth0 interface, which I use to connect to the Internet.

For all the typescript Devs, it is supported out of the box, no need to download extra packages and linters. 

It’s something to look into as who might know, it may actually become an industry standard one day taking the position where node is right now.

"Social Distancing Analyser
==================

According to WHO, at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between persons are must to reduce the spread of corona virus (COVID-19). To analyse Social distancing in a public places and carry out necessary actions to better deal with the pandemic, I developed a model which can analyse social distancing parameters by detecting distance between two persons.

This is just a demo applied on a small video, I got to learn a lot with this project. Hope you will like it.

"Looking to learn Nodejs?

How about starting by learning the following 5 things?

1. The Javascript standard ECMAScript: learning this will help you understand what JS features are supported in your Nodejs version and what is not. 
2. The languages in which you can write Nodejs applications. Namely Javascript or Typescript.
3. The Observer pattern, as Nodejs applications heavily rely on this design pattern.
4. The Callback pattern which supplements the Observer pattern in carrying out executions.
5. Basics of the V8 engine and how it executes the Javascript code that you write. It's important not to go too deep into this has it can be quite complex to understand at first.

"Closures in Javascript are possible because of two things:

1. Functions are first-class citizens. We can pass functions around like data — like any other type in Javascript.

2. Lexical scope: Based on where our code is written, the Javascript engine knows before we even run the code what variables each function has access to.

And that's what a closure is — a combination of a function and the lexical environment from which it was declared.

Closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or environment even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.

They have two main benefits:
  1. They can be very memory efficient.
  2. They allow us to do Encapsulation.
