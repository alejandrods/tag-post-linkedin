"Hello again people, out with one of my experiments again and this time I tried out the Arbitrary Style Transfer.

We all know about style transfer (Gatys et al.) which learns from style and content images, minimizing the gram matrix loss and euclidean distance loss. Then came out fast style transfer, which leverages the power of transfer learning to make this process real time, but again we lose the power to do this for any style and content image.

To overcome all these limitations, N-style papers came out, that learned from the style and content images in parallel and then the BN layers weights were shared with the style transfer network. This overcame all the aforementioned limitations, all that was left was for the networks to learn absolute generalization.

In came the Arbitrary Style Transfer paper : https://lnkd.in/gXeUAGt , at the heart of their method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Any previous issues with performance are eliminated, all using a single feed-forward neural network.

This is fascinating! No more picture uploads.
"Brilliant article (also available here: https://lnkd.in/gtP64C6), articulating views I completely identify with. 

TL/DR, and with apologies (you do need to read it): 

- labelling is unhelpful (not only everything as AI, but also arbitrarily creating subdivisions); 
- know about and respect what you are building on; 
- see beyond the tool to the application (e.g. IoT is fine as a start, but there's a lot more to making better decisions); 
- focus on creating (""engineering"") something useful, not the perfect end game of AGI."

#neuromorphic computing
while it will most probably determine development of ""third generation"" Artificial Intelligence

Intel Corporation, one of biggest players in developing neuromorphic computing explains

""the first generation of AI was rules-based and emulated classical logic to draw reasoned conclusions within a specific, narrowly defined problem domain.

the second, current generation is largely concerned with sensing and perception, such as using deep-learning networks to analyze the contents of a video frame.

a coming next generation will extend AI into areas that correspond to human cognition, such as interpretation and autonomous adaptation."" 

and significant breakthroughs are already on the way.

"During last spring semester, my team of 'Introduction to Artificial Intelligence' course, Bernadine Lye, Anita Chia and I worked on 'Mask R-CNN - Pedestrian Detection' project.

Autonomous vehicles need to identify human features accurately to ensure safe self-driving in real time. But as the types of scenarios of transportation are diversified, we are increasingly in need of more sophisticated human detection techniques. Therefore, my team reviewed the various computer vision technologies, and applied one of the state-of-art ‚ÄòInstance segmentation‚Äô deep learning techniques called 'Mask R-CNN' to the 'WiderPerson' dataset. 

Though some of the pedestrians are overlapped, partially visible, or not even stood upright, our model could still pick out those pedestrians and also pick out non-humans figures although the appearance was very similar to human. 

We had a great experience during last semester and would like to explore other computer vision techniques like 'YOLO' to solve our problem and compare them with our model to ultimately find the best model for our use case of autonomous vehicles & pedestrian detection.
Below are some of the screenshots from our final presentation!

"Competing for the title are 13 teams of musicians, artists, scientists and programmers from Australia, Sweden, Belgium, the U.K., France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. They all submitted pieces of music beforehand that were created with the help of artificial intelligence. (The organizers are not awarding any cash prizes in the inaugural competition.)

While the use of AI is what makes the event distinctive, organizers asked contestants to keep songs under three minutes and not to submit works totally created by AI. Rather, the works must feature some human element, either in the song‚Äôs composition or its performance. Teams were also required to submit written evidence detailing how they used AI in their compositions. Other than that, contestants had creative freedom to do whatever they, or an algorithm, wanted.

One team used AI to compose a bass line, which they then doubled at a couple of octaves plus a third to give them the melody. They then tapped AI to come up with the opening lyrics of the song, which are sung by synthesized voices. Another team let AI write the chords, the melody and the bass line, says Newton-Rex, who is a London-based composer and director of the AI lab at Chinese tech company ByteDance.

"Accelerating AI and benchmarking models need a perfect optimisation for efficient inferences as well.
TVM provides two level optimisations. Computational graph optimization to perform tasks such as high-level operator fusion, layout transformation, and memory management. Then a tensor operator optimization and code generation layer that optimizes tensor operators.
TVM currently ships with multiple code generators to support various backend hardware. For example, it generates LLVM IR for CPUs such as X86 and ARM. It is able to output CUDA, OpenCL and Metal kernels for various GPUs.

"My friend here developed an app which alerts you if you go 50 meters away from your home. If you have a mask, the alarm will stop else, you have to go back and get your mask. He developed this from his house and deployed the trained tf model into an android device using an app developed by his team mate. It makes us wonder if lockdowns actually have an effect on the amount of work that can be done by a person.

#AI  is only getting bigger during the current 
hashtag
#covid19  Pandemic. We have been seeing recent AI use cases in health care industry like Finding the right drug that targets the virus, Detecting virus from Chest CT scans,Creating new proteins to neutralize the virus etc.

While these are the use cases that require sophisticated data sets & can't be just done with mere ML techniques and webscraping, we do have basic attributes of AI being explicitly used by our Cops to check violations during lockdown.

It's very promising to see Hyderabad Police using AI based system to identify people who violate face mask rule.This is first of it's kind initiative in the country using Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques on CCTVs.

Hopefully we would see more of these in India, especially for implemention of law & order.

#AI to just some 'predictive analytics' or 'pattern recognition' is undermining its potential. The biggest use of AI is in 
hashtag
#design which until now was totally based on human learning, smartness, skills & experience. AI can design & redesign almost everything. It can design toxic to life-saving ( new drugs discovery with better precision to improve prognosis). It can design food ( with higher nutritional value, that tastes better, costs lesser & stays fresh for longer), It can design circular from linear ( design out waste & pollution with better material/product design & business models). It can design school dropouts to learners (design community-centric curricula & pedagogy). Usecases & applications are many. Prototyping and testing were costly and time-consuming when it was solely based on human skills & experience but with AI, rapid prototyping & testing is possible. It could correct design flaws in our existing products & business models. It could help in design-led innovation. @sanjay_abraham

"Any solution to a problem must exhibit three characteristics, i.e., doing the right thing, doing it right, and covering all the risks.

On the contrary, a solution that does not:
 - cover all the risks is mostly ""unreliable.""
 - do the thing right is mostly ""inefficient.""
 - do the right thing is mostly ""unwanted."" 

Recently launched contact tracing app received some backlash that I think was avoidable.

But then there are so many other technology solutions that fall short of some of these aspects regularly. 

I wonder if it is a matter of ignorance, incompetence, or ethics.

Thoughts?

"I am really not surprised at the amount of importance and focus that ""AI"" is getting these days.

This was the book that introduced me to Neural Networks way back in 1997. 

In 1998, I wrote my first ever ""AI based"" program in C++ that simulated a changing eco-system and behaviours of dependent ""digital protozoa"". It was something special given the fact that it had elements of NN and Fuzzy logic driving it.  

It gave me a taste of the power of AI and its possibilities. 

I dropped the subject soon after as it was not ""practical"" then, and eventually subjected myself to concrete logic. NN was out of my life, but Fuzzy Logic stayed on and I have used it quite frequently since then. 

 I am very positive on ""AI"" - are you too?

Although, this view might be biased because of the fact that this time around, I already a very good foundation ready to help me understand these sequence models. I thoroughly enjoyed the machine translation and speech recognition case studies. And let's not forget Word2Vec embeddings, a popular ntlk feature many of us would have used for various types of textual analysis without actually having any intuition on how these embeddings might have been derived.
