"In difficult times like this, it is affecting me as a citizen, as an individual and as a human for not being able to serve my society, people and country. But what we can do from our end is to stay home and stay safe. While doing so, I was able to work on some ideas, that could address the challenges faced during the pandemic. Participation and being mentored was not only the best part of this competition but also the mental satisfaction that our idea could actually help someone.

We would also like to thank our advisory board members John Peloza and Heather Donlan for all of their help with PhilUP's growth. Thank you to all the judges who gave us the opportunity to pitch our idea, and to my fellow classmates who have all worked so hard on their own innovations!

"At Concentric we continue to accelerate our efforts and celebrate our employees developing best in class products that reinforce our commitment to Technology + Innovation = Sustainability.
 
I am therefore delighted to announce that Concentric has been awarded a contract to supply its new patented Dual Cone Clutch (DCC) to a Tier 1 brake air compressor manufacturer for use in on-highway applications with one of the world’s leading OEM's of trucks, buses, construction equipment and industrial engines.
 
The clutch will be used to stop the brake air compressor running when it is not required, driving efficiency through reduced fuel consumption, lowering CO2 emissions and delivering absolute product reliability. Significant benefits can be seen, especially for long haul truck applications, where the clutch enables the compressor to be switched off for more than 80% of the total running time.
