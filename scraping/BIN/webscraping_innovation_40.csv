"üòé Innovate v.s. Being Cry Babies

üíµ Facebook and Google have also invested substantial amount of resources to build a platform where people want to be at and stay at to be connected.

Will Malaysian press share that cost as well?

üá≤üáæ Or the Malaysia press could team up together to build their own news aggregators.

üá®üá≥ A company that has done that well is Bytedance who built ""TouTiao"" or ""‰ªäÊó•Â§¥Êù°"" in China.

By aggregating and using A.I. to recommend relevant news to users, they are able to build the most valuable startup in the world, rivaling Tencent and Alibaba in China.

ü§î I guess legacy business needs to start think innovative to provide values to their customer.

Rather than thinking they deserve to get what they used to by operating the same way in the new economy.

"Here is another innovative solution for so-called radioactive nuclear waste. This so-called waste is an incredible asset for long-term generation of electrical power plus other beneficial uses in medicine and devices we use everyday.

""Burns noted that this simplified, single-step process is also proliferation-resistant since plutonium is not isolated but incorporated within the uranium crystals.""

""The idea is that the reprocessed fuel generated from our prescribed chemical reaction can be used in future generations of reactors, which would not only burn uranium like most present-day reactors but also other heavy elements such as neptunium, plutonium and americium,"" Burns said. ""In addition to addressing the fuel recycling problem and reducing proliferation risk, our strategy will drastically reduce nuclear waste to just the fission products whose radioactivity is hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands of years.""

"""Unlimited PTO"" as a ""benefit"" for employees is BS.

Here's why...AND a way better idea FOR EMPLOYEES & COMPANIES...

When a company offers ""Unlimited PTO"" it does two things: 

1) studies show employees actually take less PTO when this is offered compared to traditional models (i.e. 14 days PTO)

and...

2) employees don't ""accrue PTO hours"" so they are not paid out on them at the end of the year if not taken

What is a WAY BETTER OPTION FOR EVERYONE? 

Offer them the ability to WORK REMOTE. Stats here...

By working from home, employees: 

1) Get a whopping 98 WORKING DAYS of time back each year that is normally spent getting ready, commuting, and in unnecessary meetings/convos (3 hrs/day x 261 working days a year = 783 hrs back to employees)

2) Spend 4%+ more time per day on core work!

Which means more time spent on critical projects AND a crazy amount of time back to each person, every day! ...not to mention all the commercial RE savings for companies and home office write offs for employees :) 

....so post COVID, let's keep this whole WFH thing going  (and also offer Unlimited PTO :)) if you really want to attract top talent and get more done!

Thoughts??

"We are going through an exceptional period synonymous with a change in our habits and behaviours. 
 
This is all the more significant for me as it marks the end of my studies at Lancaster University Management School. It is a great pride for me to have taken up this challenge and a real achievement after my 3 years in the United Kingdom. 
 
I am very grateful for all the opportunities I have been able to take but most of all for all the people I have met: friends, professors, professionals.  All of them have brought me so much and I wanted to thank them. 
It's a page that is turning for me. 
 
However, it does not mark the end of my studies since I have decided to pursue a master degree at emlyon business school from September.  It is full of projects in my head that I am preparing this new start rich in experiences, opportunities and encounters.

"The current crisis has greatly stimulated broad collaboration at universities and medical centers across the country.  For example, at Duke the rapid establishment (and funding) of the COVID-19 Engineering Response Team was a result.  A strong foundation existed already from cross-campus collaborations like Duke MEDx, Duke Engineering Entrepreneurship (EngEn), Duke Design Health Fellows and campus resources including Duke‚Äôs Innovation Co-Lab.  Proximity is also key, with the various stakeholders and facilities all an easy walk across campus.

None of this would have been possible without the constant support and guidance of Adam H. Evans, Joshua Mitchell and Serenity Wright who have all worked tirelessly to help make this class a success. We would also like to thank our advisory board members John Peloza and Heather Donlan for all of their help with PhilUP's growth. Thank you to all the judges who gave us the opportunity to pitch our idea, and to my fellow classmates who have all worked so hard on their own innovations!

"At Concentric we continue to accelerate our efforts and celebrate our employees developing best in class products that reinforce our commitment to Technology + Innovation = Sustainability.
 
I am therefore delighted to announce that Concentric has been awarded a contract to supply its new patented Dual Cone Clutch (DCC) to a Tier 1 brake air compressor manufacturer for use in on-highway applications with one of the world‚Äôs leading OEM's of trucks, buses, construction equipment and industrial engines.
 
The clutch will be used to stop the brake air compressor running when it is not required, driving efficiency through reduced fuel consumption, lowering CO2 emissions and delivering absolute product reliability. Significant benefits can be seen, especially for long haul truck applications, where the clutch enables the compressor to be switched off for more than 80% of the total running time.

"This year, the ‚Äútaste‚Äù of Ramadan just isn‚Äôt the same - and now, more than ever, we‚Äôre looking for comfort. 

Danone brings back the comfort of traditional Ramadan tastes - coupled with classic Ramadan artwork - and a creative twist on the classic drink: refreshing Sobia Yoghurt and delicious Fig Yoghurt.

While this Ramadan isn‚Äôt quite the same, one thing remains true: Egyptians are increasingly looking for convenience! For the first time in Egypt, Danone introduces yoghurt salad - with cucumber and mint pieces! Simply perfect for sohoor or iftar.

This exciting news has allowed us to continue working hard on the development and evolution of our new look platform, which will be ready to launch this summer. 

With new product features, slicker design and AI-based matchmaking capabilities we believe this will enhance our value to businesses and robotic/technology manufacturers. Having already spoken to several robot manufacturers to get their feedback on our concepts, we'd like to extend the invite to our linked community! 

So, if you are interested in taking a behind the scenes look at our new platform before launch, feel free to get in touch. All feedback, negative or positive is welcome.

"The Degree is Dead, TEDx Talk at Princeton University 

Three years ago I gave a talk talking about the degradation of the college degree and the insane expense for the value it is hypothesized to create. Now that everyone is forced to stay home, with limited relationship building and social interaction - the secret is out - we are not paying a massive amount for ""the knowledge and degree"", but for the social network and experience that these institutions cannot deliver virtually. 

This leaves us to ask, how much is the virtual experience worth without the social?

If colleges are not back in effect by the fall the break in behavior and systematic questioning of value will cause people to further seek less expensive alternatives with a better ROI. Who are the EdTech startups and founders we should be watching to build this future?

"A CRM that you have to fill yourself...?? Sounds ancient... and boring.

So... we changed that! I am pretty stoked about the new prospecting tools we have built into our Active Core platform. You can easily set up ""prospectors"" to find leads on your behalf. 

Additionally, you can define a ton of qualifiers like size of the company, job roles, seniorities, geographical locations, etc...

And even further... the system will auto-send an email from emails you have written using YOUR email account and not some generic email.

Sounds difficult...?? Not as long as you can fill out a form. It's pretty straightforward and I know we'd love to demo it to you!

If interested, please PM me!

#SHIREE back in 2012. We saw that income from cattle rearing is one of the major livelihood option for farmers. But unfortunately there are very few expert veterinarian in the country. We talked to a veterinarian colleague from a NGO partner who helped to understand cattle health and management problems. 

Later at mPower, we designed the algorithm and application and our CEO helped us to generate some funding from Department for International Development (DFID) - SHIREE to do the pilot with around 200 farmers and 400 cattle. We selected two NGOs for the pilot implementation and named the service mLivestock. It is an application used by local para-veterinarians who capture and send cattle history along with pictures in a central server, and later a remote veterinarian provides treatment service through SMS/voice call. Later this application is re-branded and updated by mPower and is been used in other projects funded by USAID, FAO and others."
