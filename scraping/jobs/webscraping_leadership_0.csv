"Reflecting on the past 7 weeks and how the world has changed around us, the one thing that hasn't changed is how proud I am to work for Costa. 

I've been blown away at how amazing Costa have been not only to our Key Workers, but more so how our teams have been looked after and will continue to be once we start to open more stores. 

The Leadership and Support during this time has been world class!  

As we start to open back up in the new world I am looking forward to opening our doors, welcoming our teams and get back to doing what we do best! Creating perfect handcrafted coffee in a safe environment for our teams and customer! 

Our teams across the country have done a tremendous job over the past few weeks setting up and preparing for our new ways of working. 

The enthusiasm, leadership and passion shown by all has been truly amazing!
