"Have you had one of these from GOV.uk?

It seems Cyber criminals don‚Äôt care about shafting people in the middle of a global pandemic.

Millions of emails are being sent each day pretending to be legitimate authorities, but are in fact hackers trying to confuse people.

The vast majority of people can recognise them but some get taken in and hand over sensitive information or give people an entry point into a business‚Äô infrastructure.

Most companies offer training for staff to recognise these, but so many still fail to follow all the steps of verification of the legitimacy of emails.

It can be quite scary to think that the security of your business could be resting on how well a member of staff follows the training in recognising bogus emails.

"The current unemployment rate is over 14.5 percent -- the highest its been since 1953 (which was a record low at 2.5). 
hashtag
#Coronavirus has really impacted it. This CAN be an opportunity. (This is NOT to undermine the real struggles people are experiencing or feeling at all!)
--------
(1) An opportunity to rediscover whether or not you want to be in the area of work you're in -- yes, this can seem daunting, but it can also seem fun -- depending upon your perspective.
(2) PIVOT: It's a word that has become a fad right now -- but its true, you have every opportunity to start again. Scary? Most definitely. But regret can be even scarier. 
(3) Pick up a new skill, try a new idea, call your old business partner - push the envelope!
(4) Wake up daily with a goal in mind (i.e. I want to apply for 5 jobs today; then write 3 things you're grateful for (non-job related) -- Neuroscience shows you can't be grateful and anxious at the same time.

"Who else is still trying to digest everything that has been going on in these past few months?

If you raised your hand (remotely ‚Äì like everything else these days), you are not alone ‚Äì so are we! In just three months, COVID-19, which started out in late 2019, soon became a worldwide pandemic before anyone was able to fully understand the nature of it. And in the process, mobility has been impacted.

But as they say, when one door closes, another one opens. The pandemic may have put a hold on mobility, but it has also opened the door to employee growth opportunities, as we found out in conversations with Leonard Cheong (AdNovum), Jarrod Patterson (Henkel), and Shandy L. (Diebold Nixdorf).

We tried a new take on this piece, and we hope you enjoy the read as much as we do! https://lnkd.in/g8giBmX

"How to Manage Covid Burnout
-  Openly talk with your manager about how you are feeling
-  Seek help in prioritising and delegating
-  Manage your stakeholders expectations
- ""We are all in this together"" - yeah this one is cliche and at times I am sick of hearing it, but its true. Talking openly with friends, manager, colleagues etc helps us all deal with any insecurities, stress and lack of control we have all felt through this.

"After completing the 2 year - Part time track at USC MS in Human Resource Management, it was my dream for my 4 year old son Atticus, to see me walk across that prestigious stage this Friday. The road to get there was quite bumpy and I wavered a bit, but thankfully I had tons of support from friends, family and amazing colleagues to help me get to the finish line. I'm proud to be first generation Latinx and the first in the Hernandez family to receive a Master's degree! With this great accomplishment I can show my son, that any goal you set for yourself, is indeed within reach and possible!  

As we all adapt to world we are currently living in, Atticus will now sit alongside me and celebrate with my fellow classmates via Zoom!

"Coronavirus threw a lot of companies for a loop, trying to figure out how to manage remote work, etc. 

This webinar will be a great tool to be prepare for the unique transition back to the office."
"I came across a friend of mine who lost his job in Covid-2019.

Many firms are laying off employees,forcing resignations in the name of Covid-2019 and restructuring.

Employees are still considered to be Liabilities and not Assets to organisation.It is indeed a pity !!!

Some firms have turned a deaf ear to the Government of India directives of not laying off employees in this pandemic.

When profit shoots, firms do not add on to the proposed compensation of the employees but as profit receedes,the employees are fired citing performance issues et al.

Covid-2019 shall also pass but memories will be etched in our hearts.

"7 Things to QUIT right now:

1. Trying to please everyone - Saying, ""yes"" all the time.
2. Fearing change
3. Living in the past
4. Putting yourself down
5. Beating yourself up over mistakes
6. Waiting for someone else to make you happier.
7. Wasting your time doing stuff which is not productive.
Sometimes in life to get where you want to be requires quitting. Quit focusing on those habits which are not doing any good for you. Believe in yourself and live life with intention and purpose.

You want to know how to gain the trust of team members and customers? Its simple, tell the truth, no matter how bad it is.

"Let‚Äôs be clear about an employee not returning to work because they are paid more from unemployment- It is not that simple ladies & gents. One must prove that there are no jobs available in order to continue to receive unemployment pay. Also, a company is not obligated to continue paying unemployment to an individual who simply refuses to return to work.

Perhaps there is a much bigger Employee Relations issue than an employee not wanting to return to work then just pay.  There are a lot of good candidates out there who want to work. This is a good time to consider your employees connections to the company objectives üòâ.

With this cost-conscious approach, one can achieve savings as high as 58% of a London salary for Risk roles or 45% for Finance.

"‚ÄòBecause you are awesome‚Äô

This is the message I received from my Managing Director Geoff Crews and fellow Directors of Forsythes Recruitment & HR today. Between now and end of June each and every employee is entitled and encouraged to take 3 x ‚Äòbecause I‚Äôm awesome‚Äô leave days - no explanation needed. 

What a way to boost staff morale, culture and productivity when your hard work is recognised, especially in difficult times like these. 

I have always been a big believer in this quote from Sir Richard Branson and today Forsythes Recruitment & HR nailed it. The (virtual) reaction and energy this generosity has generated is electric and inspiring!

I am privileged to work for such an awesome company, I encourage more to jump on the bandwagon!

At one time point of time, HR was mainly concerned about employee health, safety and their general welfare, acting as a bridge between the management and the workforce. Their role also extended to organizing training programs for skill and professional development.

"EMOTIONS WILL BE HIGH AND THAT‚ÄôS OK ‚Äì Many will have had more time than they really wanted, to reflect, soul search and rediscover ‚Äì HOWEVER JUST BEFORE YOU DO RESIGN on the first day in the office;

1. Go back and reflect on the reasons why you joined the Company in the first place, is that all gone, or is there something worth staying for?

2. Explore all internal options; there will be new structures and operating plans coming, will it be possible to move to a new role or a new team.

3. If salary and benefits are a concern have these discussions with your manager; if not successful your manager's manager ‚Äì get a definitive answer.

4. If career opportunities and development appear to be currently lacking, speak with your manager and HR.

5. Talk to friends and colleagues outside the Company; REMEMBER NO MATTER HOW GREEN THE GRASS MAY LOOK; YOU STILL WILL HAVE TO CUT IT!

6. If you are still resigning, ensure you have a plan; evaluate the market, what's the true value and need for your skills and experience.

Most important, never leave your Company if the reason is who you are reporting to ‚Äì ‚ÄúNothing stays the same forever.‚Äù 

Make sound practical reasons when writing ‚ÄòTHIS IS MY NOTICE PERIOD‚Äô letter.

"Three reasons to put FairnessFirst‚Ñ¢

‚úîÔ∏è Fairness gives employees a much-needed sense of safety, comfort and security in complex and uncertain situations. It helps them feel happier and more relaxed.

‚úîÔ∏è Fairness provides the necessary support and resources for employees to protect themselves against stress and strain. It helps them feel energised and more fulfilled.

‚úîÔ∏è Fairness protects employees from anxiety, mistrust, depression, burnout, and reliance on unhealthy coping behaviours. It helps them feel cared for and more resilient. 

At The People Deal we have developed our Fairness First‚Ñ¢ Philosophy and Fairness at Work‚Ñ¢ Model using the findings of high-quality academic studies and the very best organisational practice. 

Our support, training, tools and resources help employers to create fair, inclusive and supportive workplaces.

"Today organizations are trying to develop a growth mindset in employees.

Having a Growth mindset has many benefits not just at organization level but also at a personal level, including greater comfort with taking personal risks and striving for stretched goals; higher motivation; enhanced brain development across wider ranges of tasks; lower stress, anxiety and depression; better work relationships; and higher performance levels.

I came across this Beautifully explained video on Growth mindset where Professor Carol Dweck talks about her groundbreaking work on developing mind-sets. She emphasizes the power of ""yet"" in helping students succeed in and out of the classroom.

So are you nurturing a growth mindset in your employees?

Riddle #1: How do you make the number seven an even number without addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division?

Riddle #2: Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?

Please send me your answers & I will announce the individuals who answered both questions correctly tomorrow!

These two companies alone have 165,000 employees.

We already know that other large companies are adopting the same policy.

How is this decision going to affect the economy?

Just think about office spaces, taxis, restaurants, coffee shops, office supplies, near-work shopping, etc.

If the stay-at-home employees are not going to consume these services, the outcome for the employees of these services is clear.

I feel it‚Äôs working against the reopening of our economy.

And if it hurts the economy, eventually it will hurt the companies that leave their employees at home.

As the economic pause caused by coronavirus endures, businesses are racing to understand and access the $350 billion in loans provided by the CARES Act to help impacted small businesses. Emergency loans are newly available to sole proprietors, and new guidance accompanies this relief. Estimates indicate the total amount of aid isn‚Äôt enough to address current needs, and Congress is considering extending more funds to small businesses.
This virtual event aims to help small business owners navigate the programs that are available to them.

"How much can change in one year?

Today, I celebrated one-year at BeniComp Health Solutions and it has been a year full of moments.

What moments have you had?

As a person born with a physical disability I understand first-hand how difficult accessing and affording healthcare is. I am motivated each day to remove the barriers to high quality and affordable care because the work I do impacts people and their livelihoods.

From being recognized as a Rising Star to speaking on a panel on how we can tailor health plans to meet the needs of the multi-generational workforce it has been a rewarding journey.

It‚Äôs not just about claims and deductibles, it‚Äôs about the person knowing they can get quality care at an affordable price.

Dennis a partner in the trenches who has been a champion for employers.

Dan a fellow innovator and brilliant mind.

Laura-Beth and Nick driven beyond belief.

Nancy a passionate voice for implementing health-enhancing infrastructure.

Sharon it is all about putting people first and wowing them.

Honored to know broker of the year finalists Ben and Derek.

Mark a change-agent who has transformed my life.

Kevin shows how we can influence positive and meaningful change.

David & Emma mentors and close friends.

"A question for the HR folks and recruiters in my network. I‚Äôve received a number of resumes and cover letters recently that have keywords bolded. It‚Äôs usually skills or software packages that are bolded. It‚Äôs a trend I‚Äôve been seeing more of. It felt a bit distracting at first, but I‚Äôve come to appreciate how it helps draw my attention to key skills. I‚Äôm curious if anyone else is seeing this and what your thoughts are about it? Is it a good practice or do you find it distracting?

"Do YOU have a PLAN B for your CAREER?





If you‚Äôre in IT, you‚Äôre in really good shape.

Because your skills transfer to multiple industries.

But your ‚Äúideal position‚Äù may not be something you have right now ‚Ä¶ 

Then what? 

Plan B - Got one? 

That might look like your main position is on hold ‚Ä¶ 

But to do interim consulting remotely for now. 

Times during COVID19 are unprecedented, 

So no one knows how this plays out. 

Companies may fail ‚Ä¶ 

You could be laid off ‚Ä¶ 

Hiring processes have already paused for many companies ‚Ä¶ 

But one thing we know is this.

If the current jobs don‚Äôt stay in place,  new jobs will be created.

Many of those will most likely be virtual and contract positions.

Remote work options will increase, and we all know IT is going to be in massive demand.

So your responsibility is this ‚Üí BE PREPARED. 

I‚Äôll post again about Linkedin profile optimization. 

That‚Äôs the first place you can start. 

More hiring managers and recruiters are on Linkedin today than ever. 

Get out there. 

Stay healthy ;)

"Being a student of Kingshuk Bhadury  Sir, one thing I can say is that this course will just not introduce you to basics of HR analytics, but will do so in such a lucid and simplistic manner that it'll remain with you as a concept even if not practiced.
That's the beauty of his style of imparting learning.

Whoever is interested should not think twice to join in.

"To all HRs, with love, from every professional ever:

-If you're not hiring, please remove any open positions from all job portals

-If you can't afford to onboard a new employee, let them know. Don't indefinitely defer their joining for nothing

-If a candidate is no longer in the running, let them know

-If you know you might be looking at laying people off in the times to come, communicate to them in time

-If someone completes an assignment as a part of the selection process, give them feedback. Don't let these creative people think their intellectual property was misused

-If you don't have the budget (+/- 10%), don't initiate the process. Don't put a candidate through so much only to put a shocking figure at the end

-If someone reaches out to you, be kind enough to acknowledge

-And lastly, if you want the industry to look up to your culture, preach it every step of the way. And yes, that includes treating potentially future employees with respect as well.

The above list is the result of innumerous stories from multiple people in my network. You have a massive responsibility, being the face of your company, dear HRs. Don't mess it up :)

"Guidance has been published which outlines how holiday entitlement and pay operate during the coronavirus pandemic. It is designed to help with workers who:

* continue to work

* have been placed on furlough as part of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme

It confirms:

* Employers can require workers to take holiday and/or cancel a worker‚Äôs holiday, if they give enough notice to the worker.

* Workers on furlough can take holiday without disrupting their furlough.

* Where a bank holiday falls inside a worker‚Äôs period of furlough and the worker would have usually worked the bank holiday, their furlough will be unaffected by the bank holiday. However, if the worker would usually have had the bank holiday as annual leave, there are 2 options: the bank holiday is taken as annual leave or the bank holiday is deferred.

* The amount of pay that a worker receives for the holiday they take depends on the number of hours they work and how they are paid for those hours

"2017 article from my Human Capital Management class ringing true today - especially in the midst of economic uncertainty and organizations considering workforce redeployment:

""With companies expecting increasing flexibility and agility from their staff, a key aspect of maintaining relationships is that the psychological contract is upheld. The very need for adaptability may run counter to how things have been done before, and so changes in the needs of the company may be perceived as breaches of the contract. Proactively managing employees‚Äô expectations therefore becomes an ongoing and necessary process.""

"The realms in which we work are both complicated (predictable) and complex (unpredictable). Complicated realms, offer the certainty of expertise to determine outcomes. The complex realm, is the domain of uncertainty - unknown unknowns, where outcomes can't be predicted or solved using expertise alone. This is the domain of ‚Äòemergence‚Äô. To thrive in complexity we need to let go of the temptation to find a solution. Instead of leading from a place of ‚Äòprobability‚Äô (what we think will happen), we lead from a place of ‚Äòpossibility‚Äô (what could happen). Instead of leading from past experience, we lead with presence, knowing there is no definite destination to get to, only moment to moment direction that emerges from curiosity and the creative space of the collective. That means letting go of needing ourselves and others to ‚Äòbe right‚Äô, since there are no right solutions in complexity.  Thriving in complexity means letting go of our fear of failure and instead learning from it. Creating ‚Äòsafety zones‚Äô for people to make ‚Äòsafe-to-fail‚Äô bets. How ready are you, to lead in this context of uncertainty? If you‚Äôd rather thrive than just survive let‚Äôs have a conversation.

"Many professionals wonder what they can transition to doing as a second career, and teachers are no different. I'd asked myself many times what else I was qualified for and capable of doing based off of the many 'teacher skills' I have. I tried health/voluntary insurance sells, as I really wanted to help others, but wasn't the pushy kind of salesperson and starting your own business not only once, but twice after a move was too much for me. I wanted something I could work from one location, help others and enjoy where I work, thus my move to the HR field, plus teachers are well-versed at taking tests, so another one is no big deal! ;-)
