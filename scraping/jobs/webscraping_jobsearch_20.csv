Dear Job Seekers

"I got a rejection email from Google.

I applied to be an engineer with them a couple of weeks ago.

It was, quite literally, the nicest rejection email I‚Äôve ever received.

Other companies have sent me automated rejection emails with DO NOT REPLY listed at the top. Most companies didn‚Äôt even reply.

Meanwhile, Google

-sent an email from an actual person, not an automated response

-wished me and my loved ones safe

-encouraged me to keep applying and said they‚Äôd keep me in mind for other job opportunities

-offered to give me resources about roles I‚Äôd like to apply to and their hiring process

-encouraged me to reply if I had any questions about my application

If this is how they treat job applicants, I can only imagine how well they treat employees. I am confident that‚Äôs how they attract top talent and continue to dominate the world in technology.

‚Ä¢ you are responsible for your career, no one else is
‚Ä¢ in job search, model the behavior of those who have found employment
‚Ä¢ focus on your toolkit not just on your resume, toolkit includes items such as Accomplishment Stories, Target Company List, One Pager, LI profile, Letters of Recommendation...)
‚Ä¢ build & maintain an active network, this is your most valuable career asset
‚Ä¢ people negotiate when buying a house or a car but they don‚Äôt negotiate for a better salary

"The #1 tip on how to list your references on your resume is to...

‚õî Just skip it! All it does is take up valuable space. If the recruiter wants to know your references, they‚Äôll ask for it.

üëç The only case you‚Äôd want to include a list of references is when the job description explicitly asks for it. 

If that IS the case, here‚Äôs how each reference entry should look like:

‚û°Ô∏è First name, last name
‚û°Ô∏è Professional title
‚û°Ô∏è Name of the company
‚û°Ô∏è Business address
‚û°Ô∏è City, State, Zip
‚û°Ô∏è Phone number
‚û°Ô∏è Work E-mail

Do:
‚úîÔ∏è List your biggest fan first
‚úîÔ∏è Clarify your relationship

Don‚Äôt:
‚ùå Overshare
‚ùå Include personal information

"$50k - $150k

That‚Äôs the price headhunters charge for executive job search services. 

I know because I just read through 5 proposals that were sent to one of my new clients. ;)

Oh ‚Äî Plus a 5% fee on the base salary.

You might think that‚Äôs shocking unless you make $500k - $1M.

At that level, the signing bonus alone could be worth 2, 3x that. That makes a move worth millions.

Now, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre not quite there but you want to get there. 

You know that to do so you‚Äôll need to make another move first. 

But how?
 
You‚Äôre busy. 
(**Executive women work 10 hours a day + Saturdays on average)
 
You probably haven‚Äôt looked for work in about 10 years. 

And those expensive professional clubs aren‚Äôt getting you there.
 
This isn‚Äôt about just a resume.
This isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúapplying‚Äù
This isn‚Äôt about what the other ""guys"" are doing.
 
This is about you.  What are you doing?

What do you believe about your worth?  

What‚Äôs the cost of avoidance and confusion?
 
What‚Äôs the cost of a messy, passive job search? 

Hint: The exec search firms know it's more than $50k.  
 
That‚Äôs why I created services and a community to support your move.

Whether that's a power move or a million-dollar move... Let's make it happen.

I am looking for an entry level position as an accountant or auditor(or associate). I have some accounting experience(about a year) and will be completing my B.S. in accounting by December. 

I am also pursuing a second B.S. in cybersecurity, an M.S. in Forensic Accounting and Fraud Examination and i have started studying for the CPA exam. 

All the above programs are online and at my own pace, which presents no problem while working full-time. 

If anyone is aware of any opportunities, feel free to reach out to me. I am interested in the DMV area, plus any potential remote positions. Thank you in advance.

"Video Interviews
Treat it like a regular face to face interview
 
According to a report by software firm Jobvite 80% of recruiters use video for interviews, and 61% use video when screening candidates. Video interviews can understandably be challenging for job seekers. Some people just have a discomfort with being on camera. People feel conscious about how they look on video, or they‚Äôre worried about whether their technology is going to hold up. That's why it's important to work out the wrinkles before your interview. In these   times most businesses are operating remotely, the standards for hiring talent have not been relaxed.  The interviewing process is just as aggressive as it was, and it's not as easy when it's not in person, so be as prepared as you can.

"When an unemployed person sends you a connection request on LinkedIn.

1. Accept their connection request.
2. Don't judge someone based on their job title.
3. Treat others as you would like to treated.
4. Help as you can. Like, share and comment on their posts.

Unemployment is temporary. Life is unpredictable. The person you reject today, you might need their help tomorrow. ""We rise by lifting others.""
Agree?

"Level up your job search by keeping yourself accountable.

Track how far you get in each interview process. 

Know these numbers every week: 

üëâüèæ How many new companies/roles applied to.

üëâüèæ How many recruiter phone screens completed.

üëâüèæ How many hiring manager screens completed. 

üëâüèæ How many on-sites completed. 

üëâüèæ How many offers received.

Track these numbers over time so you can better understand your success rate at each interview stage. 

You'll get insight about where you need to focus & improve. 

Bonus tip - calculate the conversion rate between stages and focus on increasing that percentage over time.

"0 TO 100, REAL QUICK...

You need to pay the bills. 
You want a fulfilling career. 
You live to make an impact.

You are versatile and valuable. 

You can make more money, save more money and save more time for any organization on the planet. 

BUT...

The number of interviews, offers and earnings you generate is contingent on 3 factors...

1) If you cannot quantify, articulate and differentiate your value on your resume, LinkedIn and during interviews, your options will remain limited.

2) If you are not engaging influential business leaders and empowered hiring managers, the right way, every day, your options will remain limited.

3) If you are not asking the right questions, discovering challenges, and presenting your growth solutions, your options will remain limited.

FACT...

If I were to review your strategy, content and execution, most of you would score below 10% (despite giving 100%).

That is why you feel helpless and depressed every time you get rejected for jobs and passed over for target promotions.

"COVID-19 has taken so many people's jobs, internships.

Some will get other offers. 

Others may not. For them-a suggestion.

Why not spend the next week researching how you can build an income stream online?

I got a taste of this a few years back.

I started 3 niche websites over a 1 year period in 2017-18.

Those sites, built over the course of several weekends and early mornings before work, still make me some money every month even though I haven't touched them in well over a year.

In early 2018, I got bored with building niche sites and moved on to SEO consulting for some time. 

I helped other blog owners grow their website traffic and monetize it. 

With just ONE client, I would work 3-4 hours every weekend and earn more than I would at my day job all week.

The point of this isn't to brag.  

I want to point out that, regardless of your situation, the internet is full of opportunities. Use them.

And if you have the luxury of not worrying about money:

My projects taught me copywriting, content marketing, how to generate organic traffic, branding, monetization, and many other skills.

If I were on the job market, I wouldn't have to tell recruiters about my skills- I could just show them.

Why can't you do the same in your areas of interest?

"Don't forget to say Thank You!  

The importance of sending a Thank You note can't be over emphasized enough.  In fact, following up with a thank you could very well be the deciding factor between you and another equally qualified candidate getting an offer. 

Here are some common questions about thank you notes:

‚úÖ When should I send a thank you?  Within 24 hours of your interview.  I suggest sending an email thank you the same day, and sending out a hand written thank you the same day as well so it arrives the next day.

‚úÖ Should I send a thank you to everyone I met with in the interview?  YES.  Make sure you have their contact information including the correct spelling of their name.

‚úÖ What should I include in the note?  Here is a great format: Show gratitude for the opportunity to interview, include something specific about the conversation, mention why you are excited and why you would be a great fit.  Include your contact information in your signature. 

I would love to hear from my colleagues that are hiring leaders! How important is sending a thank you note after an interview?  Has a thank you note ever helped you make a decision in your hiring process?  Comment below ‚¨áÔ∏è

"This is not a basic post about the future of my career. Instead, I think it would be best to share the wisdom I accumulated after navigating a 10 month 
hashtag
#jobsearch in college. I hope something will resonate and help you.

Job searches are not fun. Mine seemed never ending and there were several instances where I was 100% certain I had a job - but was ultimately disappointed. 

1.) Keep learning. If you learn and improve from opportunities that didn't work out, you will be prepared for the one that will. 

2.) Network, network, network. I did not find my job at a career fair. I found it by putting myself out there and scheduling phone calls with people at companies and positions I could see myself in. Give it a try. 

3.) Find peace. Have an open mind. Don't stress about what you can't control. Control what you can control and let the process guide and teach you. You'll emerge with strength, wisdom and patience. 

After learning the 3 lessons above, I was finally prepared for the position I was meant to find! I have accepted a position with Bloomerang as an Account Associate! No matter how much I wanted it to, I'm blessed that my job search did not work out earlier because I would not have become who I am now. 

Also, apply for jobs in Harry's Chocolate Shop. I'm 1 for 1."
