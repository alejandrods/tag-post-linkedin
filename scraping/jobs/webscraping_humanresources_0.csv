It was fun doing this video with Siddharth. Bit longish and hopefully I don‚Äôt come across as full of myself ... Sidd actually wanted me to focus on learnings from my career. Blame him for that :) Naga Siddharth

*NEW JOB ALERT*
"How much can change in one year?

Today, I celebrated one-year at BeniComp Health Solutions and it has been a year full of moments.

What moments have you had?

As a person born with a physical disability I understand first-hand how difficult accessing and affording healthcare is. I am motivated each day to remove the barriers to high quality and affordable care because the work I do impacts people and their livelihoods.

From being recognized as a Rising Star to speaking on a panel on how we can tailor health plans to meet the needs of the multi-generational workforce it has been a rewarding journey.

It‚Äôs not just about claims and deductibles, it‚Äôs about the person knowing they can get quality care at an affordable price.

Dennis a partner in the trenches who has been a champion for employers.

Dan a fellow innovator and brilliant mind.

Laura-Beth and Nick driven beyond belief.

Nancy a passionate voice for implementing health-enhancing infrastructure.

Sharon it is all about putting people first and wowing them.

Honored to know broker of the year finalists Ben and Derek.

Mark a change-agent who has transformed my life.

Kevin shows how we can influence positive and meaningful change.

David & Emma mentors and close friends.
