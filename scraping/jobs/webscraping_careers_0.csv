"This is great advice. Networking is very important, and I agree with all he has shared. 

From my recent experiences and what I have learned, I would add: Know what you want for your career, purpose of networking with that person, and how they may be able to help you. Combine that with being genuine as he mentioned and the person you are networking with will likely remember you and follow up with what you have asked.

And as mentioned... it's a process. Hang in there!

From my perspective - now more than ever counts effectiveness and performance of each person in the company, especially those who are in direct contact with the customer. Each unattended or poorly served client is a loss for the company. Multiplied by the number of days of the company’s operations in the year it seems to be a drama not only for a financial director. 

Let me give this example: In a hotel, more important than the marketing director responsible for attractive advertising is receptionist. This receptionist gives credence to the promise made in advertisement. FULL STOP.

"I secured lots of internships in second year of uni.

Here’s how.

In my first year, I achieved highly.

I was awarded a scholarship based off the inspirational Stephen Lawrence’s legacy.

I was selected to sit on my student union’s trustee board.

I achieved a 2:1 in my studies.

Then I panicked.

I felt like becoming a lawyer was still out of reach.

This gave me imposter syndrome.

I tried to get lots of internships to compensate for this.

I applied for internships through my law school.

I held up a sign up asking for experience.

I asked everyone they knew and their cousin for internships.

However, after getting multiple law internships, I still got rejected at job interviews.

I learnt something very important:

“I don’t need more work experience to prove that I am good enough. I am good enough.”

This turned a page for me.

I stopped attributing my success in law to how much work experience I got.

I started attributing my success in law to who I was as a person.

I learnt that all the legal work experience in the world wouldn’t get me a job.

Only I could.

Believe in your experiences.

Develop yourself personally and professionally.

Proactively seek new opportunities.

That will get you through the door, not just more experience.
