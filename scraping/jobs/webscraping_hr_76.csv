"This is so true.

Some (most) job ads are so dull and boring and then hiring managers wonder why all the candidates aren't what they're looking for. 

It's such an endless cycle and it stops brilliant people applying for what could actually be a deeply fulfilling job, simply because it's not been sold to them properly.

"Why has there been a 60% increase in unfair dismissal claims reported to Fair Work Australia, compared to this time last year?

1. An obvious one - more dismissals and unemployment due to Covid-19.

2. Nervous employees seeking some financial security following dismissal given lower prospects for finding new employment.

3. Dodgy employers using Covid-19 as an excuse to terminate or abuse the Jobkeeper scheme.

What can 
hashtag
#Employers and 
hashtag
#HR people do to reduce the chance of a claim? 

1. As usual, there is a process to follow, stick to it!

2. Employers need to be transparent with their employees, giving them both good and not so good news. If there's a chance redundancies may occur in the future then employees need to be informed.

If employers don't have HR people and aren't sure of the process, they should seek assistance.

"Boris Johnson has said people who cannot work from home would now be encouraged to return to work - but they should avoid using public transport to get there if possible.

He wants people to drive, cycle or walk to work but he made NO mention of skateboards, pogo sticks, roller-skates or space hoppers. Read into that what you will! 

Mr Johnson mentioned construction and manufacturing as examples of industries which would now be explicitly encouraged to restart.

He also said that employers will receive guidance on how to become ""Covid secure"".

In advance of that, Robinson Ralph Limited is offering the following FREE resources for employers: 
 
‚Ä¢ A guidance note on returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 
‚Ä¢ A Workplace Social Distancing Policy.

"In addition to Brigette Hyacinth post  

I have come to believe that most recruiters feel it‚Äôs a privilege to be invited for an interview. It‚Äôs more like a notion, of ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm offering this candidate an opportunity‚Äù they should play to my rules.

However, we need to understand it‚Äôs more than that. This is a two way process. You saw something in me, that was why you invited me for an interview, there is a value I‚Äôm adding to the company if I‚Äôm hired. Why should I be treated less? Irrespective of the number of candidates interviewed, a simple feedback regarding the application is expected. 

Furthermore, for candidates who contact HR to know about their application, such applicants should be given detailed and constructive feedback (if possible) for following up on their application.

Dear recruiters, you can reject a candidate, but your feedback can help the candidate get another job. it‚Äôs all about the learning process for candidates, what can I do to get better, how do I land my dream job, did I use the STAR approach? 

Enacting Constructive feedback in the hiring process can help improve the talent acquisition process positively.

"People are the backbone of every organisation. They are frequently described as the ‚Äúgreatest asset‚Äù, yet what other asset has 30% of its form described by a crude average such as a standard headcount allocation? When organisations take a view on how they control labour cost in response to the pandemic, they need to make sure they can actually see the true cost of reward at the employee level, and look at all cost categories (salary, bonus, pension, benefits and shares) in relation to each employee. uFlexReward offers employers all the reward data they need to make informed decisions on the workforce for both the short and long term. www.uflexreward.com

"We know we need to look after our crisis workers, particularly now. They are at higher risk of burnout as they are in roles that demand perfectionism and as any mistakes may have incredibly dire outcomes. Burnout happens over a period of time and with sustained pressure. 
An interesting read for us all to learn from and consider for ourselves and others around us. Know the symptoms and consider options for support. Ask for support from your HR Consultant - they can support and point you in the right direction

"One of the subtle shifts that enable successful leaders to consistently grow and deliver strong performance through complex and difficult times is that they‚Äôve stopped asking questions that begin with ‚ÄúHow do I...?‚Äù and replaced them with ‚ÄúWho can help...?‚Äù When you do this over time, the sum total of ‚Äòwho you know‚Äô becomes ‚Äòwhat you know' (AND can get done quickly and effectively.)

With that in mind, it‚Äôs a privilege to be hosting these 6 leading experts on behalf of Travel Daily Media, to help leaders in the travel and hospitality space, navigate a new path forward during these unprecedented times.

"""But when 
hashtag
#HR comes in to confine talent to boxes, to fit imagination into checklists, and to put the lid on enthusiasm, it all bursts into a violent clash of values: one that‚Äôs at the core of why companies rooted in tradition are struggling."" Never truer words spoken. 

And align this statement with the article appearing in The Australian today ""America appears near to major economic depression and social collapse, and this is now top of the list of dangers from COVID-19"", writes Alan Kohler. 

And hopefully the lessons to be learnt coming out of this period of uncertainty and the imbalances in this world today, will be to respect and empower every individual ""to feel free to show their passions both in and outside of work, to drive change by employing the full range of their talents, to express their curiosity and uncensored enthusiasm, (to enable them as) the ones best positioned to thrive in the future.""

"Dr Allin-Khan hits the nail on the head. Again. This thread is superb. 

My own off the cuff thoughts...

1. Go to work if you have to but don't use public transport. This jeopardises everyone and probably the most vulnerable employees. And what about childcare? 

2. ""Some"" hospitality ""might"" open in July. So businesses cannot plan and remain entirely in the dark. 

3. Go out and about more than once a day but only with people from your household. This is an open invitation to the less responsible amongst us who are already pushing the boundaries. 

4. Some primary school years might go back in June. Who will be working out the mixed age school run protocols or dispensation for those parents who don't want to send their children back?

Trust me, I know when I say it. When all this has passed you will be a few steps closer to achieving it!

"Let‚Äôs talk about employee happiness üòÅ

Although money is a part of happiness, studies have shown that it‚Äôs not the main thing that determines employee happiness...üí∞

Here are the top üîü factors according to a Harvard Business Review study:

1Ô∏è‚É£ TRUST and RESPECT - from employers, colleagues and of course it must be reciprocated üòå

2Ô∏è‚É£ FAIRNESS - regardless of their rank, sex, gender, race or religious beliefs, all employees are human beings üßïüèæüëµüèºü§±üèæüë¨

3Ô∏è‚É£ They feel LISTENED to - we need to unlearn what we know about listening. We need to know how to actively listen to others üëÇüèº

4Ô∏è‚É£ RELATIONSHIPS with colleagues ü§ó

5Ô∏è‚É£ LEARNING and CAREER DEVELOPMENT - they want to progress in life, if they feel stagnant, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll leave the company ü§ì

6Ô∏è‚É£ FINANCIAL and JOB SECURITY ‚õì

7Ô∏è‚É£ A WORK-LIFE BALANCE ‚öñÔ∏è

8Ô∏è‚É£ Interesting job CONTENT üìö

9Ô∏è‚É£ Company MORALE and VALUES üíé

üîü Work APPRECIATION - do they find their work meaningful? üßê


Happy employees = great ROI. Take a look at the image‚Ä¶ üò≥ü§Ø

As promised, here is the second lesson I would like to share from the webinar:
Opportunity 2: Look back for resilience and move forward towards success
I looked at this learning from a personal lens: It always been difficult for me to look back at my past mistakes because it made be feel vulnerable. But these past couple of weeks (in lockdown) made me more introspective. I started looking back at all the challenges I overcame these past few years and rather than feeling vulnerable, I feel empowered to move forward. Learn and forge on! 

How about you? What was the biggest challenge you ever experienced and how did it help you be a better person? Share your thoughts.

"What‚Äôs next? (Ctd)

So as we wait to hear from Boris (not the press) whether there will be more than garden centres opening, it has been reported that the government is considering introducing a legal right to work from home.  Apparently, employers will only be able to refuse it if the work cannot be done at home.  

I am an advocate for flexible work and it is fantastic that this crisis has probably pushed that agenda forward by 10 years in 10 weeks. Saying that, I am interested to see how this will be different to the current legal right to request to work flexibly.  It will now doubt give it some welcome publicity if nothing else.

It is worth remembering that this proposed legislation is not required for good and forward thinking employers to continue any practices which have ensured sustainability and business continuity during the Covid crisis.  What is required now is an employer with:
 ‚Ä¢ great leadership (courage, compassion,   clarity);
 ‚Ä¢ current HR & legal advice; and 
 ‚Ä¢ a mindset to learn and grow from this crisis.

"As organisations and senior leadership teams rightfully focused on creating business continuity plans to ease the transition into a fully remote workforce, many managers were caught off guard with the sudden shift from an office environment to all employees needing to work from home.

However, in an emergency situation, like the one we find ourselves in now, training management on how to manage remotely is often the last thing on anyone‚Äôs mind.

After all, if they‚Äôve been trained how to manage in person, it‚Äôs the same as doing it remotely, right?

Not quite.

Here's how to set expectations and manage your newly remote teams >> https://bit.ly/2VBnpLb

"*The End can be the Beginning*
.
.
.
.
Just like those James bond movies, in which no matter what happens, Bond never dies, you have to make yourself stern and rigid.

End may be the end, or it may be the beginning, or it may be the midway, who knows? But we can either have a positive approach or a pessimistic one. Decision lies in your hand.

End becomes the end only when you make it the end.

#IBM Study show that 75% employees think that Location Independence is important. This means that organisations will have to move up the Location Independence scale and allow their employees to work from outside the offices. 

What does it take ? 
1) Process Simplification : It is very difficult to follow a complex process anywhere, and especially frustrating if you cannot ask Dave, why he had to put that extra note on the top !!  

2) Digitization :  Because, good luck with the logistics of paper based remote working

3) Automation : It is actually a subset of 2. And if nothing else, it could be a quick and easy link between your existing legacy system process and the new age collaboration tools.

4) Training : To be effective and efficient while working remotely needs a whole different set of soft skills.  

Allow more and more employees to work from outside offices - Be Location Independent

Whereas CONFLICT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH. The best way to resolve conflict is to see it as an opportunity for growth. Growth has only one sure path and it is through conflict. 

Conflict is growth trying to find expression. CONFLICT MUST NEVER BE IGNORED OR AVOIDED: Conflict is not the problem, avoiding conflict is!

"A quick question people
is it really necessary to either place your staffs on redundancy or outright lay them off because of the COVID 19 crisis. i believe this is a phase that will pass sooner or later and the world order will go back to normal, economic activities will resume and businesses will start to flourish once again, then this organisations that has laid off diligent and dedicated employees will return to the HR market to fill those vacuums they created in a panic period. 
shouldn't we advice our management to either be patient or adopt pay-cut till all of these is over?.

Few days ago when I was reading about how

"Employers asking for the Previous Base Salary for benchmarking is Unfair! üëá
 
Finally, somebody raising this important topic. I couldn't have said it better myself. Whoever came up with that rule is the Slave Master.  The previous base salary is irrelevant and is tantamount to locking candidates in poverty and amounts to further exploitation, what if one was underpaid in their previous employ!  I also strongly believe that Your Value Add Proposition determines your worth. It is what should set the stage for the wage proposal or negotiation not the last payslip!.

"Do you have a staff onboarding process? 


Onboarding is the process of integrating new employees into a business. 

What process do you have in place to ensure that you have a consistent method of that person coming on board including completing documentation such as contract, position description and induction checklist. ‚úÖ 

Onboarding is really important in terms of the culture in the business. The first few days for a new staff member are always key. Do you ensure that the new staff member has their desk set up, email established, business cards? Even introducing the new staff member to the other staff in the business and letting them know the safety aspects such as first aiders, fire wardens and emergency evacuation details are important. 

The onboarding process does make that new staff member feel welcome and part of your business team. It is through onboarding that employees learn how to meet the expectations of the company. By aligning new employees with their role, they feel needed and important in the organization. This helps them associate themselves with the workplace culture. ‚ù§ 

What onboarding steps do you have in your business? How do you make new staff members feel welcome in your business?

2020 might become a pivotal point for businesses to review their talent strategy. With the current Covid-19 situation, companies have had to adapt to new ways of working, attraction, retention, engagement and development. 

I believe once the global economy recovers, we will see a renewed war for talent, where companies will need to compete beyond attractive compensation packages. These talents will be looking for career growth within an organisation and this gives business leaders an opportunity to review their career mapping strategy with HR. 

I think the paragraph below from the article sums up the importance of career mapping for tomorrow: ""Ultimately, career mapping allows the organization to prioritize satisfaction and career growth and thus, develop the workforce they require while increasing the attractiveness of the company to the caliber of talent needed to fill skills gaps."""

"While a move to Level 2 represents a reprieve for many small businesses, and a big sigh of relief (along with a well-earned ""woo-hoo!"") for the rest of us, the bigger businesses (and maybe some govt departments) in NZ have a rather different challenge on their hands; namely, ""how do we embed all that we have learned while we all had to stay home?""

The simple truth is, that meme had it right: Covid-19 has accomplished a big chunk of the Digital Transformation that we were all struggling to deliver before the pandemic. Even businesses like AirNZ (and who would want to be leading an airline just now?) will have been getting down to the core of their future mission and purpose. And, yes, it hurts.

My guess is that the biggest takeaway will be that ""who"" is actually the big focus going forward. The systems (the ""how"") had to be put in place, under high time pressure, and that was accomplished across many businesses in record time, from all I have seen. But the impact of having the right people in the right roles will have been very obvious. So how do we capture that and bottle that? 

It can be done...

"A few thoughts when applying for any job at any organization:

1. Fill out the application completely. HR is going to swipe away your application in 3 seconds if it‚Äôs not. And why do 90% not to complete the other 10%. 

2. Make sure you answer any cultural questions. Don‚Äôt spend so much time giving answers to questions not asked. What HR wants to know is that you understand emotional intelligence and how to apply it.

3. Check your spelling. If you don‚Äôt take the time to proof your life‚Äôs greatest professional successes (on two pages), you may not take the time to make sure projects less important than your life are done right. 

4. Don‚Äôt just randomly apply for ‚Äúanything‚Äù. Unless HR is desperate, which we are likely not, we‚Äôre not going to entertain applications that don‚Äôt tell us what you are really interested in and passionate about. And make sure the job that you are applying for actually exists (see photo). 

5. Want to do what the organization is doing and believe in the mission. Don‚Äôt show up and when asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how interested are you in the job say ‚Äú8‚Äù. We don‚Äôt want you to not want to do your job 8 hours a week.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it about fatty? Tell us now!‚Äù I hear you cry from your sofas.

Alright. Calm down. I was planning on telling you. You‚Äôre so impatient and rude. Be nice! 

The webinar will focus on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on employers and will explore what you need to be aware of should redundancies unfortunately become necessary.

By the end of the session you will know:

‚Ä¢ the practical implications of COVID-19 on undertaking a redundancy process;

‚Ä¢ the importance of collective consultation despite the logistical challenges presented by COVID-19; and

‚Ä¢ the issues an Employment Tribunal will consider in claims for unfair dismissal.

Sounds riveting doesn‚Äôt it? 

What‚Äôs that you say? ‚ÄúNo, it doesn‚Äôt. It sounds well boring‚Äù. I do wish you‚Äôd stop being so mean!

"*The Confidence Game*

.
.
Confidence is defined as a quality or state of being certain. It is a key element of a strong character.

You need to be certain about your abilities, qualities and judgement. If you are uncertain, it‚Äôs difficult to convince anyone to be certain about you.

Trying out new things, making new experiences, reading self-help books, and many other things may help out bringing the confidence in you.

Developing self-confidence is not optional. It is mandatory.

"Gartner identifies 9 trends broken into 3 categories... accelerating trends, new impacts, pendulum swings that will impact the Future of Work!"
"Organisations are now moving to the next phase of planning during the pandemic.

The impact of the virus has tested organisational and individual resilience to the full.

Attention is moving towards the gradual return of people to the workplace.

There are logistical plans and risk assessments to complete, but ultimately what we are dealing with is an exercise in human emotion.

Anybody who says they have not felt stressed or worried over the last couple of months is probably being disingenuous.

There will be a range of emotions for people to process on their return to work.  Some may feel relief, with the reassurance of returning to familiar routines.  For others, it may be fear.  Will my workplace be safe for me and others?  

Managers will need to demonstrate a healthy degree of emotional intelligence during the reintegration to work phase.  Reactions may vary, and there is never any substitute for open communication and sincere listening.  There is no single answer here, each person and each situation is unique.  

When considering new ways of working, the handling of emotional responses is likely to be the biggest factor in successfully supporting people back to work.  A genuine people first approach will be crucial.

""" Like"" if you agree with what Mr. Nagaraj HR has to say about employment gap and ""Comment"" if you have something to say about it too... I personally agree with him totally as the employment gap is usually more due to lack of effective placements and recruitment along with incompetent job hunting, rather less on the account of lack of technical skills of the candidate.

#IMF estimated that the VAT rate increase would have a positive impact on the kingdom's GDP far more significant than water and wage reforms or savings from capital spending and interest payments.

KSA, the Arab world's largest economy, is implementing wide-ranging economic reforms to reduce its reliance on oil following Crown Prince's

"Great article about the problem with reporting employees solely as an expense on the balance sheet according to U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).

Are employees really just an expense?  

Some updates are in order.

Any thoughts to share?

Thank you!

*Edit: Perhaps the simplest way of attributing asset value is the actual cost of the salary and benefits that an employee is paid.  Doesn't that indicate what the employer believes the employee's contribution is worth?

"Running up to 2025, Tata Consultancy Services will ask a vast majority of 75% of its 4.48 lakh employees globally (including 3.5 lakh in India) to work from home, up from the industry average of 20% today. 
The new model called 25/25 will require far less office space than occupied today. ""We don't believe that we need more than 25% of our workforce at our facilities in order to be 100% productive,"" says TCS's chief operating officer N. G Subramaniam.

This could leave a great impact on other companies to follow the same working model.
Apart from the issue of maintaining social distance in offices till the pandemic is over or we find a vaccine, following can be the benefits to a company as well as employee:

The employees who have moved to the city in which their office is, they'll be saving on accommodation rent, food and travel expenses(if any) plus they can be with their families.

Whereas the companies will be saving a lot of money in maintaining office spaces and bearing travel expenses for the employees.

Feel free to add your thoughts.

"HELP! It's not very often that I reach out to ask my wonderful LinkedIn tribe to help me with something...but today is one of those days.

It's been just 43 days since a group of five global wellbeing professionals came together to launch Kite Support www.kitesupportapp.com : a learning resource filled with everything you could possibly hope for to navigate change and uncertainty (while growing an understanding of resilience along the way).

Anecdotal feedback has been amazing, but we would like to curate more formal testimonials and reviews.  This will help us to better understand the user experience, and make sure our project does exactly what we want it to.

User feedback will also give us extra information to share with potential new clients (so it's more than just us saying ""we think it's great""!), we want to be certain that it is great and we want to use real, honest feedback to support our claims.

If you've used Kite Support, please could you contact me about your experience (PM), and together let's make a difference to global strength and resilience.

Truth
"As some states begin to shift into their specifically detailed ""phase 1"" reopening of businesses, you can see the immediate change effects. Customer experience and employee work experience both look considerably different, and will likely continue with many staying changes.

Along with those changes come the natural reaction of resistance... both from our customers, and employees. If you have implemented change before, you know the processes of change can be especially tricky if all the phases are not allowed (or in the case of our current situation, not able) to run their course. Because of this, it is beneficial to us as leaders to review the following article which highlights important tips to implement change in the face of resistance. Additionally, as we get our employees to accept the change, we must educate and enable them to carefully push those same changes with positive attitudes in order to ease the customer base into also accepting them.

Change is upon us; getting back to normal will not be as simple as the way it once was. Both our employees AND our customers will be thrust into the change process without the benefit of appropriate change process times... plan for it now.

"A thought:

When companies ask for ‚ÄúX years of experience in ___‚Äù, what are they really asking for?

To quote I√±igo Montoya, ‚ÄúI do not think it means, what you think it means‚Äù.

Companies want to attract experienced talent that can bring new ideas and innovation to the table. 

And yet when their job descriptions ask for ‚Äú5 years experience in sales‚Äù, what they‚Äôre really saying is:

‚ÄúWe want one year of experience in sales, repeated 5 times‚Äù. 

What‚Äôs the value in that?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it is of course important to want applicants to have some degree of experience and/or knowledge in the subject matter of the job. 

But what about that person with 2 years experience in the role you‚Äôre hiring for, but 3 years in another role that would provide them with a different perspective and cache of knowledge? 

Personally, if I wanted a basket of fruit, I wouldn‚Äôt choose the one with 8 apples, but the one with 3 apples, 3 oranges, and 2 mangoes. 

I don‚Äôt think companies value diverse experience (experience in roles or industries that are not directly aligned with the job being posted) nearly enough, and with the proliferation of computers sorting through applications many candidates who could provide a huge value impact are being cast aside.
