"You know what I want?

Feedback.

I‚Äôm tired of receiving ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry to inform you we‚Äôre not moving forward with your application.‚Äù

It makes me question whether my resume was ever even read.

If a company told me, ‚ÄúWe decided to move forward with a different candidate who has more coding experience‚Äù or something then I could work off of that to improve my skills and my resume.

And I‚Äôm confident companies would receive applicants who are excited to work for their company and turn into great employees. Great employees work where they feel appreciated and fulfilled.

"Your resume shouldn't ""boldly go where no man has gone before.""

All the work you did on your resume and you're getting zilch.

You might as well have sent it to outer space somewhere. 

If that's you, you'll want to check out a free on-demand video resource. 

I'll walk you through step by step how to format your resume to get through ATS (the pesky Applicant Tracking System) and give you a resume template you can download.

The videos are short, helpful and you'll have lifetime access in case you ever want to refer back. 

Get access, get through the system and start getting seen by human eyes.

"Our seniors have taught us...
There is no issue or problem in accepting the 
hashtag
#facts...

sharing some 
hashtag
#linkedin facts (my personal observation though :)

Linkedin is floating with...

1. 
hashtag
#Layoffs news
2. 
hashtag
#jobseekers prayers to get a job ( Very few to help them though)
3. Every Pandemic creates an opportunity.. so as the Layoffs 
hashtag
#Resume writers have overshot the number of 
hashtag
#jobs available on this platform :) ( Fact so accept it). 
5. The Linkedin 
hashtag
#job board is full of inactive jobs (But Irony of the fact is Jobseekers are still applying). Brigette Hyacinth has already raised this issue a couple of days back.
6. Jobseekers can also have them enrolled for INR 499 or INR777 ( there are many different price points available in the market, created by some 
hashtag
#product superheroes) to learn how to use Linkedin to grow network & get a 
hashtag
#job ( as reminders, reader of this point can again go back & read point no- 5)
7. If all the above has already been tried & tested :)... then we have the Linkedin's decade-old remedy... there are posts which says, just comment ""HI"" or ""YES"" or ""Interested"" to get a job...

If anyone here looking for a job change, don't put any like on this post or comment...
Just simply write an email to me, I will try my best to help for FREE (email ID on the first comment)."
"I‚Äôve been having absolutely no luck finding a job. Attached is my resume, please help me get hired. Feel free to message me, email me about any opportunities.

"Great job Brett Iredale and JobAdder

""The results are in.  Over 700 recruitment agency owners and leaders responded to our survey, looking at the impacts of the coronavirus on the recruitment industry. A huge thank you to everyone who participated.  

Here are a few of the things we learned;

43% of recruitment leaders expect to start hiring again in 2020.

66% plan to implement flexible working from home options after restrictions are eased.

28% say that their team communication has IMPROVED during Covid-19 (weirdly, we have found the same at JA).

30% have experienced mental health issues during this pandemic.

59% are highly, or cautiously optimistic about the future.

"Sharing the words of Google recruiter Elizabeth Morgan:

""At an old company I volunteered to greet candidates when they came in for onsite interviews. I'd give a quick tour, make them coffee, take their coats, etc. I LOVED getting to know people and easing their interview nerves.

""One leadership candidate came in and before I could even introduce myself, they handed me their coat and asked me for a water. It made me feel so small and uncomfortable.

""After they left for the day I sat in on the hiring team conversation like I always did. Our leadership team was REALLY excited about this person. 

""I decided to bring up my interaction with the candidate and the energy in the room grew somber. Other folks started talking about how they also noticed the candidate gave off (on several occasions) red flags about their ability to be a team player. Within 5 minutes this candidate had gone from an IN THE BAG HIRE, to‚Ä¶ let's call them tomorrow to let them know we won't be moving forward. 

""There's so much that goes into a hiring decision. Your interview starts the moment you share your resume. Be aware of how your actions come across and how the company responds to them; it just may be the reason they don't move forward with you or YOU decide they aren't for YOU! :)""

I won't lie, he is not the cheapest but if you consider all his after sale services he is the best value for money you could invest in with your work applications."
"Did you know -

- Candidates are not offered jobs as they have little knowledge of the company.
- Candidates with negative body postures are not fit for the role.
- Resume plays an important role for an interview.

"Keeping a resume ready, with most of the content in place from the first year itself just makes it easier to add experiences later, as you gain them.

Though it seems futile to write a document where you need to enlist your experience when you don't have any actual experience, it gives me a sense of the things that I can do in the near future. That‚Äôs where an Internship Resume comes in picture.
 
So, I encourage all my first-year friends and batch mates to build their resumes from this moment itself, if you haven‚Äôt started already. This will be very helpful when you apply for internships later.
 
Also, Thanks to Abhishek Kateliya for teaching me the importance of building a resume and a LinkedIn profile from the start, without which I wouldn‚Äôt be sharing this right now!

Feel free to view the resume that I have created as a part of this course, on my Profile!

‚úÖWe met over 10 years ago. 
‚úÖAnkit originally reached out looking for opportunities in the US. 
‚úÖI wasn‚Äôt able to help him immigrate but I did give him an opportunity to join my team and work remotely. 
‚úÖOver the years he became a key part of the team and is now my right hand man. 
‚úÖWe would talk everyday creating needed recruiting, coaching and back office strategies. 
‚úÖSeveral years ago he was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer. With the help of his family, friends and myself, we raised enough money for his surgery.  He‚Äôs been 100% healthy ever since. 
‚úÖIn September 2019 he finally got his visa and for the first time in 10 years we met.

"Are you a premium 
hashtag
#product?

Yes, I am talking about you, Fresher's.

Yesterday, I have been thinking while learning about ""
hashtag
#Quality"" and suddenly this struck my mind :
hashtag
#Fresher's are like those products which 
hashtag
#Customers (
hashtag
#Recruiting companies) wanna buy (hire) after a thorough inspection of quality attributes (desired skill set).

You wanna 
hashtag
#satisfy your customer then you must do these:

‚óèKnow your 
hashtag
#Unique Selling Proposition (why they should hire you?)

‚óèTell about 
hashtag
#competitive advantage which you are gonna offer ( In what ways you will benefit the company?)

‚óèKnow the customer(Company) 
hashtag
#requirements and conforms your 
hashtag
#standards(Skill set)

‚óèYou maintain your standards(integrity) and higher quality(wider skill set) and you can be a 
hashtag
#premium product(Higher 
hashtag
#Salary Package)

Think of these points while you prepare your 
hashtag
#Resume and getting ready for an

#Interview. This will definitely help you getting placed in good company with good

"Hello LinkedIn and the community, 

During these tough times that we have all been facing, job search has become a lot of people‚Äôs high priority. In such a situation, every minute counts and every minute wasted would have been great to be put into something more productive. You agree? 

Here is an idea I had for LinkedIn, what if there is another filter in the job search which says ‚ÄúWork Authorization‚Äù? Me and a lot of my friends have faced this problem where we spend time to look at the jobs which match our profile, spend some time to apply for the job, spend some time to schedule a meeting with the recruiter via LinkedIn, talk to the recruiter and finally after all this efforts, we get to know that the profile doesn‚Äôt accept our work authorization or visa status. This process takes ~30-60mins per job and finally, there is disappointment. We now repeat the same process till we find the right match. 

Adding a work authorization filter in LinkedIn for both Recruiters and the candidates which would filter out most of the un-matching profiles and would let us spend our time on better profiles and end up in the job sooner than later?

"Spot on advice here from a good friend, that I hope can help others during these difficult times! If there is a company you‚Äôve always wanted to work for/the dream role - then go for it! Don‚Äôt stop at a single apply on the career board and hope for the best. Stand out from others by getting to know everyone you can from department execs, heads, VP‚Äôs even C-suite! Ask the right questions and find out how they can help you work towards making it happen (some folk you‚Äôll speak with in these companies are financially motivated to refer/help you too). As my old man says, don‚Äôt fear anyone or anything in business...üí™"

"Amid this 
hashtag
#lockdown, I have encountered many 
hashtag
#posts by various 
hashtag
#startups regarding 
hashtag
#internships mostly unpaid. they are posting it as if they are the 
hashtag
#lifesavers in no man's land and are working very hard to rescue the

#careers of the students especially first-year 
hashtag
#MBA 
hashtag
#graduates as they are frightened that their 
hashtag
#resume will look bad for final 
hashtag
#placements.
But let me tell you the harsh truth of this time, they are utilizing this 
hashtag
#COVID-19 as their opportunity to get free labor from these students who are trying there best to get themselves enrolled in some internship programs. They are exploiting the 
hashtag
#students like hell, breaking all the code of conduct.
It's my sincere request to all first-year MBA students not to worry about their internships as the 
hashtag
#industry is well aware about the current situation and like you there are many others.
So just keep calm and stay safe. Don't get lured by those so-called guarding angels.
All those startups should use this situation to focus on building trust in the market or on the 
hashtag
#growth opportunity, not as an 
hashtag
#opportunity to exploit. Because one day these MBAs will be your client working in different companies.

P.S:- Any suggestions or comments are highly welcomed

"Hello Everyone,

I hope you and your family are safe during these crisis. 

I have spent my last 10 Years working with Students, College‚Äôs, Universities, School‚Äôs around the country. I have always truly loved helping student‚Äôs take their next step and helping them prepare for their careers, while helping college‚Äôs & universities I have the tools & trade for recruiting & counseling students for International Education.  

Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was laid off with no estimated date for when things may return to normal. I am open to any possible positions at this time, I would love to continue working within the international education field at any level. I appreciate any leads that anyone may have for any position that may be open or any company that may still be hiring during these testing times.

Please let me know if you have any opportunity/opening which I can be a good fit for or if you can help me connecting with the hiring team/recruiters. Kindly help in order to reach out to maximum people who may have been looking for potential candidates for the relevant roles of my expertise.

"A lot of my friends who had offers are getting laid off or offers are getting revoked, putting them back in the job market.
I just conducted a mock coding interview for one of them and it was a lot of fun and I'd like to do more, because I want to help other people and it helps me get a better idea of what the interviewer wants. So if anyone here wants to do a mock interview (either as the interviewer or interviewee) shoot me a DM and we can figure something out. My main languages are Java and Python but I can basically interview you in any language you want.

"You have listed a third language in your resume?


I had a unique experience today being interviewed by CityRecruit Recruitment Co. The interviewer noticed that I had listed Japanese language in my resume. So, the interview went something like this:

Interviewer: ""You have an elementary proficiency in the Japanese language? Have you taken the JLPT test before?"" 

Me: ""Yes, I have a basic understanding of the language.  Unfortunately, I have not sat for the JPLT test before. However, I did take Japanese in my SPM and studied it again in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTPOfficial).""

Interviewer: ""I see. So, can you introduce yourself in Japanese?""

Honestly, I was surprised. Speak Japanese in a job interview?Never experienced it before! Immediately, I spoke in Japanese with all the ""karat"" knowledge that I have. I spoke confidently and didn't bothered much about making few grammatical mistakes. I believe that he must be proficient in Japanese as he understood what I was saying. New achievement, unlocked!

So, friends! Especially the fresh graduates, let's be wise to prepare ourselves beforehand for the ""foreign language"" that we have listed in our resume.

"Very powerful reminder for everyone: you are not your resume/titles.
 
This concept that you are defined by ""three bullet points"" on your resume is outdated. When it is all said and done, no one will care about that ""prestigious transaction"" you closed or where you worked. What will matter, though, is whether you were a kind person and treated people nicely.
 
Triston Francis brings up the book ""The 100-Year Life ‚Äì Living and Working in an Age of Longevity"" by Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton which redefines how we should think about our careers.
 
The average 8-year old has a greater chance of living to 105 years and this has tremendous implications for how we should view work/life balance.
 
What is your take on work/life balance especially during quarantine?

"While technicality is a great part of any job, the personality of every member of the company may enhance the quality of the projects substantially.
Be it a human or a machine scanning your resume, the target metrics are often similar; school prestige, GPA, and test scores are still top filters, however, the validity of using these factors to screen candidates has been called into question.

In the process of job hunting, I found 
hashtag
#Pymetrics, a platform where it will describe your cognitive and emotional results while also will compare it to the general population. This is what you cannot find in a 
hashtag
#resume, and in my opinion, this is what recruiters should look deeper into!

What use is it to live in the age of big data and 
hashtag
#machinelearning if we are not taking advantage of the potential developments??

Let's Rethink!!"

"Reminder to job seekers: The first person to read your application and resume is, in all likelihood, not in your profession or department, before it even gets to the hiring manager. 

Bear that in mind, to avoid technical language, acronyms, or super specialized jargon. What might seem like a very logical jump from your experience to the job, may not be obvious to a recruiter. We try our hardest to learn about the industries and skill sets for which we recruit, but do not live and breath it like you do every day. This greatly increases your odds of getting your resume past the initial round of screening! Not sure what is implied and what you should spell out? Ask a Recruiter.

"Hello connections, we have a job. Apply Fast!!"
"How to write a stunning 
hashtag
#CV, elegant and easy to read! 

It is clear to me that good schools and great experience are often not related to a higher chance of getting a job interview. Even a cover letter sometimes does not help, and you question yourself why I did not get at least an interview with that company? My skills matched the job description!

Most of the companies do not even ask anymore for a cover letter during the first stage of recruiting process. So everything depends on how you sell yourself with your CV. It is key to write a short CV (max 2 pages!), well presented, tailored to the job description and easy to read! You might have great experience but if your CV is not catchy enough the hiring manager will be bored after reading 2 lines and will switch to the next candidate. Yes, because they have probably hundreds of applicants and they cannot waste time in understanding your CV.

I came across a code edited by Nick Strayer, I modified it and created an R package (fairly) easy to use for beginner R programmers. Stunning and elegant layout that will make your CV look great! The attached CV is created with the 
hashtag
#cv R-package (link below) that is based on the 
hashtag
#pandoc

#resume template.

#resumetips for all

#jobseekers :

1. One of the most looked for component of your resume is your professional summary. 
2. Your professional summary should highlight your value proposition to the company, your 
hashtag
#corecompetencies and some soft skills required for the job. 
3. The first line makes most of the impact so it should tell the 
hashtag
#recruiters  why are you important for them. 
4. Use adjectives like accomplished, constructed, delivered, influenced, established, optimised in the professional summary.
5. Spend adequate time to design your summary to attract recruiters and it should be tailor-made for every application.
6. Please follow the 
hashtag
#ats format if you are applying through job portals to reach the desired place.  
7. Should not more than more than 3-5 lines. 

Recruiters only take 7 seconds to screen each resume. So you have to take a great deal to be worthy enough of getting selected in those 7 seconds.

"Ways to help your friend or colleague who's been laid off:
-Tell them you want to help! People don't want to assume, so make sure they know you want to help.
-Write them a LinkedIn Recommendation (as long as you can speak to their professional skills).
-Share resources, like The Job Sauce's free resume review https://lnkd.in/gc8QQEF
-Offer to make intros. In the job search world, getting referred is the best strategy.
