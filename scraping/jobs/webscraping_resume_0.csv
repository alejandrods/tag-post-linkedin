"You know what I want?

Feedback.

I’m tired of receiving “we’re sorry to inform you we’re not moving forward with your application.”

It makes me question whether my resume was ever even read.

If a company told me, “We decided to move forward with a different candidate who has more coding experience” or something then I could work off of that to improve my skills and my resume.

And I’m confident companies would receive applicants who are excited to work for their company and turn into great employees. Great employees work where they feel appreciated and fulfilled.
