"It was a well spent night with 40 young talents from different universities in 4 different countries. Thank you everyone who joined us in the Virtual Career Workshop last night.

We shared with them about the topics of Resume Writing, Cover Letter and LinkedIn during the 2 hours session. It was an interactive session where everyone were constantly asking questions. The session went slightly more than 2 hours.

This workshop was set to help all job seekers, fresh graduates and university students to prepare themselves before employment. Hope that they had gained valuable knowledge from the session.

It was the 12th Career Workshop from DR Resume Services and we had received 100% positive feedbacks from the participants. Thank you!

Due to overwhelming response from the participants, Sunday and Wednesday's session were both fully registered. DR Resume Services decided to organise a Final Session of Virtual Career Workshop to all job seekers.

Final Session of Career Workshop will held on:
Date: 16th May 2020 (Saturday)
Time: 3pm-5pm
Venue: Zoom

Registration URL: https://lnkd.in/gNeV7-z

"6 DAYS TO GO...

Last week the Professional Speakers' Association India Mumbai Chapter leads, Brig Sushil Bhasin and Jitendra Gupta reached out to me for doing a keynote on Finding Your Speaking Niche for its members. 

To my surprise, almost 40 speakers, trainers and coaches attended and when I asked them questions like what do you think is speaking niche or do you have a speaking niche, they responded enthusiastically... 

As we premiere the Speaking Niche Mastery Series in 6 days, this is a great validation that there is a great need for speakers to work on their speaking niche. Are you working on yours?

If you are keen at working on your speaking niche, block your place here: https://imjo.in/jAnKq2

2. Play with keywords - If you have the skills the employer is looking for do not refrain from mentioning it in bold on your resume.

3. Remove common skills ‚Äì Add specific skills that your manager, recruiter is looking for.

4. Make sure your resume is simple and easy to read - This is because employers have a minimal amount of time.

5. Proofread and edit - Undergo several rounds of reading for spell checks or grammatical errors.

My current CV is a PDF one-pager filled with specific examples of my achievements and formatted so that it is easy to read while containing all the information needed.

When I was just starting out, I never thought it would look like it looks now. Let‚Äôs see what it looks like in 9 more years.

"Good expose' on the difference between ""Lean"" and ""Agile"" and the misconception that Lean simply means ""cutting"" waste. A company should be well-versed in both methodologies, understand how they are complimentary not competing techniques, and be open-minded about how both tools (or religions as some see it) can be employed to improve business processes and beat the competition. Maybe we start by calling it ""AgiliLean""...thoughts?

"‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt leave their jobs, they leave toxic cultures‚Äù

People don‚Äôt leave their jobs, they leave their bosses‚Äù

These ideas are true but have been pushed around as if employers are always the guilty party whenever people leave their organizations. 

The employment relationship is like any other relationship. Either party could be the guilty party.

There are people who actually leave their jobs but not their bosses or toxic cultures. Some people just don‚Äôt want to commit to a long term relationship. Some don‚Äôt find enough challenge/inspiration in their jobs and move on, some realize they are meant for something else and move on.

There are also toxic people who don‚Äôt fit into good cultures or don‚Äôt get ahead in meritocratic environments. When such people leave, it is good news for the employer because they have been saved from having such people polluting others.

"Well, Yes, Today is my last day of working at NIAR. It's been 1.5 yr since I started working as a Research Intern and Assisted in various aircraft manufacturing company projects based on composite testing. I sincerely Thank my Manager, supervisors and finally Team Members for making me learn the things real quickly. They made me understand the value of Time and Team management. I have practically experienced about the process involved in composites testing and strain gauging according to ASTM standards. I personally thank my friend Rohith for his reference. I strongly feel that the tools and terminology skills gained from this organization will definitely help me in my career while searching for jobs.

"Maya Angelou said ‚ÄúIf you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.‚Äù Attitude matters period! It affects everything... from relationships, to the way you perform at work, and how you choose to interact with those around you. The most important step you can take toward achieving your greatest potential in life is learning to monitor your attitude. 

In the workplace there will always be something, or even someone, we do not like or care for. We won‚Äôt always be able to change our environment to correct the matter. This is not an excuse to be unprofessional. Instead, adjust the way YOU think. A positive attitude is what will truly help one to cope. Here are three strategies you may find useful!

(1) Affirmations repeated several times each day. They can have a positive impact on mindset and negate falling into negative thought patterns.

(2) Holding grudges against something or someone in your ‚Äúmind‚Äù is harmful and can produce a bad attitude. Be forgiving and just move on! 

(3) Always act with a purpose. Your actions should always be in line with your core values. Often times if I recall to mind my values I can prevent myself from acting out in a way that conflicts with them.

"WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?

Most of us have been on lockdown for almost 8 weeks.  In 8 weeks what NEW SKILL have you learned?  

Here's what I've been learning:

- Trading
- Value Investing

""The only skill that will be important in the 21st Century will be the skill of learning new skills"" Peter Drucker

If you are reading this and haven't invested in yourself, in up-skilling or re-skilling, you are missing a trick.

The train will not wait for late passengers.  So get yourself future-ready, or you will be in for a major shock my friend. 

You're welcome.

"As a graduate, gaining the experience aspect for any field can be extremely hard. 

Employers should be looking for characters with perseverance, passion and motivation within prospective employees. Most instances, people get rejected at the application level but you really get to know an individual in the interview stages... get to know the people."
"There‚Äôs a misconception that it‚Äôs a red flag to see breaks in a r√©sum√©. Job seekers tend to assume that companies prefer candidates with work experience that seamlessly flows from one employer to the next; many people worry about how to explain common occurrences such as being laid off, quitting a bad job before having a new one, taking extended family leave or experiencing a personal emergency that temporarily takes them out of the workforce.

Here are five tips to help you comfortably discuss your time out of the workforce and cast it in the best possible light.

Women in Tech: How to break into Product Management? 

Have you ever thought about a career as a product manager? And if so, have you given up because..:
- you were afraid to apply
- you thought you wouldn't be selected.
- you were worried about having the wrong background.

When Ma√Øa Metz, founder and CEO of No√© (www.noe.pm), the Bootcamp to train the next generation of Product Managers received applications for the first batch (starting in June)... 80% of those being men! The 20% of women who applied had very relevant backgrounds but often lacked confidence. Ma√Øa is certain that the strength of a Product team also lies in its diversity. 
 
Join Ma√Øa Metz on Zoom next Tuesday, May 26th. During this event she'll be talking about the profiles that startups look for Product roles, and answer all of your questions about how to break into Product Management!

"I secured lots of internships in second year of uni.

Here‚Äôs how.

In my first year, I achieved highly.

I was awarded a scholarship based off the inspirational Stephen Lawrence‚Äôs legacy.

I was selected to sit on my student union‚Äôs trustee board.

I achieved a 2:1 in my studies.

Then I panicked.

I felt like becoming a lawyer was still out of reach.

This gave me imposter syndrome.

I tried to get lots of internships to compensate for this.

I applied for internships through my law school.

I held up a sign up asking for experience.

I asked everyone they knew and their cousin for internships.

However, after getting multiple law internships, I still got rejected at job interviews.

I learnt something very important:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need more work experience to prove that I am good enough. I am good enough.‚Äù

This turned a page for me.

I stopped attributing my success in law to how much work experience I got.

I started attributing my success in law to who I was as a person.

I learnt that all the legal work experience in the world wouldn‚Äôt get me a job.

Only I could.

Believe in your experiences.

Develop yourself personally and professionally.

Proactively seek new opportunities.

That will get you through the door, not just more experience.

"How to make your resume stand out?

1. The key to making your resume attractive to a company is to tailor it to the job description.

2. Play with keywords - If you have the skills the employer is looking for do not refrain from mentioning it in bold on your resume.

3. Remove common skills ‚Äì Add specific skills that your manager, recruiter is looking for.

4. Make sure your resume is simple and easy to read - This is because employers have a minimal amount of time.

5. Proofread and edit - Undergo several rounds of reading for spell checks or grammatical errors.

You think you have the best resume?

From my perspective - now more than ever counts effectiveness and performance of each person in the company, especially those who are in direct contact with the customer. Each unattended or poorly served client is a loss for the company. Multiplied by the number of days of the company‚Äôs operations in the year it seems to be a drama not only for a financial director. 

Let me give this example: In a hotel, more important than the marketing director responsible for attractive advertising is receptionist. This receptionist gives credence to the promise made in advertisement. FULL STOP.

Regardless of the fact that we've not yet been able to work in the same room, she has been an excellent addition for us and has slotted in perfectly to our ASR family.

Also, to anyone who is cautious of on-boarding employees remotely during this time, it can absolutely be done and be done well. Feel free to reach out if we can provide any advice on this. We'd be happy to help.

"Are there any good RECRUITERS out there?

Recruiters generally suffer from a negative or bad reputation and they are even seen by many employers as a 'necessary evil' when it comes to finding staff.

There are many employers who will NEVER use recruiters - ""we're not paying those ridiculous fees.""...""they just keep sending us CV's which don't even match up.""...""I don't even think the candidates were interviewed before they come to us.""üëé

Candidates from all walks of life, white or blue collar, have at least one horror story to tell about their experience at the hands of a recruiter.

""I have not heard back from him for weeks.""...""she won't even return my calls.""...""all I got was an email reply telling me I wasn't suitable.""üò†

Recruiters are everywhere - So how will you know which one best suits you?

Here are just a few key tips...

‚úî Partner with a recruiter - it's your CAREER & not just a job
‚úî Qualify them - HOW much & WHO do they really know?
‚úîSeek recommendations from family, friends, colleagues & your network
‚úî Set some guidelines for YOU and the RECRUITER!

I know everyone's circumstances differ but you need to have CONTROL.üëå

And we all know what comes from a RELATIONSHIP - TRUST!üëçüíô

"At career conversations (https://bit.ly/caconv), I realise professionals who are stuck haven‚Äôt been able to switch from traditional channels (e.g. walkins, job portals) to create new career opportunities. 

The way I see it, every channel has its limitations both in terms of depth and breadth of options that the channel can provide. 

Beyond a point in one‚Äôs career journey, one will be required to evolve their way into a different channel based on one‚Äôs goals. May have to create one too.

Happy channeling! :)

"Do you want to know the one secret that can make your team stick with you and in fact follow you wherever you go!
 
Each individual needs to grow since constant progression and growth are critical to keeping us motivated and happy. When we as leaders stretch our team members, give them challenging assignments that push them out of their comfort zones, that‚Äôs where they relish their mind opening up and learning new things!
 
Remember, growth always happens out of the comfort zone! Yes, there will be some initial internal resistance, however, as a leader you are expected to show the confidence and push them to do it!
 
Most of the leaders I have seen feel guilty about stretching the team, however, in my experience, your top performers will love the experience of being challenged outside of their limits and they will do whatever it takes to do it.
 
Don‚Äôt you enjoy the experience when your leader trusts you with some critical, high visibility, challenging task and the joy on their face when you go back and deliver it!
 
Try it for yourself and let me know what happens!

"How will Covid19 end? Will it be a medical breakthrough or a socioeconomic path of frustration and exhaustion of the disease affecting normalcy?  With protests and economic worries, we will push a ""back to normal"" feel into society, but at what cost? Will Media die down the importance of precautions causing the virus to silently increase confirmed cases and deaths, until it fades away? Historically, pandemics have been infiltrating our populations for centuries, with only smallpox to consider as a pandemic with an actual medical end.

"This is great advice. Networking is very important, and I agree with all he has shared. 

From my recent experiences and what I have learned, I would add: Know what you want for your career, purpose of networking with that person, and how they may be able to help you. Combine that with being genuine as he mentioned and the person you are networking with will likely remember you and follow up with what you have asked.

And as mentioned... it's a process. Hang in there!
