"And here's the team BiCT, almost complete! Well, the picture may not give us justice, but the hearts, how beautiful are they? üòç

From Monday on, part of the team is going to return to the headquarter after almost 3 months, a long period in which each of us had to face several changes and difficulties. Some of us had to slow down work, while others had to double up or reinvent their job. Somebody has had their family around them, and others still couldn't hug their loved ones!

Despite the distance, we supported each other, keeping up the team spirit that characterizes us! üåª
I wish everyone a great phase 2.1, with safety distances and masks, we can still smile to each others with our eyes üíò

"Think!

Thinking is one thing we are always # # # # # # # # too busy to do. 
Our brains have the capacity to do much more than we allow it.
You get creative ideas when you think.
You make the right choices when you think things through before initiating an action.

Are you out of jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic or you are facing some pandemic-related financial or career challenges?
Just do one thing...take a break, find a quiet spot and think through
Now, I dont mean worry, worry is an overwhelming thought that makes you anxious, afraid and incapacitated
But when you maximise your brain capacity, you think outside the box, you come up with creative ideas, you become a problem solver rather than waiting for hand downs, you create a business niche for yourself....just think...think!

"Hey guys, looking for a 
hashtag
#job at top companies? Check out Instahyre for jobs at Microsoft, Amazon, D.E. Shaw and more than 2000 companies."
"Why a job closer to your home is better than one that pays you more but needs relocation or hectic travel everyday. While we all have preferred jobs that offer us great careers along with excellent remuneration but also requiring us to relocate or commute longer. 
Covid time has taught us all a lot and it may be time to re-evaluate some of this as well. Ofcourse this is not the right time to change your job but if you are impacted due to business changes then do keep this in mind. It doesn't matter in the long run if you made 20% more for a role in Bangalore though you are a Delhite--u take your cost of living given the benefits of being at home with your family. Having done this a few times myself--the cost benefit analysis tells you something else when you add all the additional costs of travel and losing out on family moments. So rethink and don't let monetary aspect be the major decision maker. Also if you know your business will get impacted in the next couple of months make a decision now basis this than wait for that grand opportunity that pays you more in a different city.  Another important aspect is re-adjust your expectations at this time from a hike perspective--what worked pre-Covid times has changed a lot. 
Hope we can all make some great decisions.

"Expected jobless claims eased further from their record high.

Another 2.98 million people have filed initial claims for jobless benefits in the U.S.. This represents the smallest number of initial claims since March when Coronavirus really took its toll on the market. Although in the short term this is slightly positive, there is no signaling of any meaningful turnaround in the labor market. 

Looking to be another week of volatility our analysts have a bearish outlook on the dollar as the weeks close approaches.

"The financial services sector in Canada comprises many roles related to the fields of accounting, insurance, and investment. In March 2020, The Conference Board of Canada released a report which highlighted Toronto as the second-largest financial centre in North America and the seventh-largest globally, in employment.

Many newcomers to Canada have a background in finance and intend to continue working in their field after moving. However, since most finance-related roles are regulated occupations, newcomers sometimes find it challenging to navigate the job market. In this article, we will help you understand how to analyze the scope for finance occupations in Canada and make a successful transition to the Canadian job market.

"üìåThe job market is very competitive now. Applying to every job and hoping to get few calls back is the worst strategy you can have right now.

üëâüèªQuality of jobs over quantity of jobs is what‚Äôs going to win.

‚ùìWhat can you do??
‚úîÔ∏èPick your top 3 jobs/roles of focus
‚úîÔ∏èResearch them
‚úîÔ∏èTweak the resume as per the job description
‚úîÔ∏èCompile your success stories
‚úîÔ∏èConnect with people/networking
‚úîÔ∏èMake applications

Your job search may look a bit different than it did in the past ‚Äì you‚Äôll need to have patience. 

Continue your job search with some modifications and the role you‚Äôve been looking for might pop up in an unlikely place.

If nothing is working right now, use this time to lay the groundwork so that when the crisis is over you have opened doors and rekindled relationships. 

Until then focus on what you can control - improving your skills and yes Don‚Äôt overlook the power of networking.

Then I spent sometime understanding what do these people, the happy ones, do differently form the others and I found the secret - they do the job they are passionate about!

But not all of us are lucky to be in a profession inline to our passion. Neither all passions can be monetized! What should we do?

Here in this video I share three steps you should follow to successfully convert your passion to profession and live life happily ever after ;)

"Being laid off is probably one of the most traumatic events any employee can face during their career. After all, most of us take pride in our work and a portion of our self-worth is built with the company we worked for.

This article that talks about Glass Door laying off 1/3 of its workforce really caught my eyes, especially this paragraph:

""Laid off employees will receive a minimum of three months pay, have healthcare costs covered through the end of the year and receive accelerated vesting of stock options through severance periods, the company said. Departing employees also have the ability to keep their Glassdoor laptop to help with job searches.""

Only at this moment, the true core values of a company will be shown. How its management views its responsibilities to its employees will set it apart from others.

For those 30+ million people who are facing the uncertainty of job market, I share your pain and anxiety. There is light, because there are more and more companies that are trying to do the right thing.

"There are a lot of scams out there, be careful NO JOB should ask you to deposit company money into your bank account. Especially to distribute somewhere else. 

They use real company names to lure us in then scam us. So far they have used Bitcoin name falsely and this one used Bang Energy drink. However these companies are real but they do not represent the REAL companies. 

Never Ever deposit a check in your account unless you are 100% sure of the issuer.  Be smart!

"A couple of days ago, I was informed that my summer internship with Digitas North America was cancelled due to COVID-19. Although I am extremely bummed, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to network with other interns within Digitas and other incredible individuals through MAIP. 

As this has been a difficult time for everyone, I believe it is important to address that it is okay to feel overwhelmed. May is Mental Health Awareness month. Although it has been tough, I took a breather and realized that these times will pass and that we will eventually achieve some kind of normalcy at the end of all this. 

As a result, I have taken some days to be mindful of my mental health. I have also tried to keep an open mind and brush up on technical skills. There are plenty of websites that offer free online certifications, courses, and training. For example, I am taking a strategy training camp and online courses on Adobe Creative Suite. I encourage you to take advantage of those online resources too.

I am currently searching for internship and full-time opportunities relating to marketing and advertising. Please let me know if you hear of any openings that you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be a good fit for. Thank you for reading and stay safe!

"We both left home at 18,
You cleared JEE,
I got recommended.
You got IIT,
I got NDA.

You persuaded your degree,
I had the toughest training.

Your day started at 7 and ended at 5,
Mine started at 4 till 9 and
Some nights also included.
You had your convocation ceremony,
I had my POP.

Best company took you and
Best package was awarded,
I was ordered to join my paltan
With 2 stars piped on my shoulders.
You got a job,
I got a way of life.

Every eve you got to see your family,
I just wished i got to see my parents soon.
You celebrated festivals with lights and music,
I celebrated with my comrade in bunkers.

We both married,
Your wife got to see you everyday,
My wife just wished i was Alive.

You were sent to business trips,
I was sent on line of control.
We both returned,

Both wives couldn't control their tears, but
You wiped her but,
I couldn't...
You hugged her but,
I couldn't.

Because I was lying in the coffin,
With medals on my chest and,
Coffin wrapped with tricolor.
My way of life ended...
Your continued.
