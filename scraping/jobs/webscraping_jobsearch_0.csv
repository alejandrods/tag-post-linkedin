"I got a rejection email from Google.

I applied to be an engineer with them a couple of weeks ago.

It was, quite literally, the nicest rejection email I’ve ever received.

Other companies have sent me automated rejection emails with DO NOT REPLY listed at the top. Most companies didn’t even reply.

Meanwhile, Google

-sent an email from an actual person, not an automated response

-wished me and my loved ones safe

-encouraged me to keep applying and said they’d keep me in mind for other job opportunities

-offered to give me resources about roles I’d like to apply to and their hiring process

-encouraged me to reply if I had any questions about my application

If this is how they treat job applicants, I can only imagine how well they treat employees. I am confident that’s how they attract top talent and continue to dominate the world in technology.
