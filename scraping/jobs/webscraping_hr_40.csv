"Here is the link to Prof Dave Ulrich’s webinar: https://lnkd.in/gAKR8Qj 

As promised, here is the second lesson I would like to share from the webinar:
Opportunity 2: Look back for resilience and move forward towards success
I looked at this learning from a personal lens: It always been difficult for me to look back at my past mistakes because it made be feel vulnerable. But these past couple of weeks (in lockdown) made me more introspective. I started looking back at all the challenges I overcame these past few years and rather than feeling vulnerable, I feel empowered to move forward. Learn and forge on! 

How about you? What was the biggest challenge you ever experienced and how did it help you be a better person? Share your thoughts.

"Do you have a staff onboarding process? 


Onboarding is the process of integrating new employees into a business. 

What process do you have in place to ensure that you have a consistent method of that person coming on board including completing documentation such as contract, position description and induction checklist. ✅ 

Onboarding is really important in terms of the culture in the business. The first few days for a new staff member are always key. Do you ensure that the new staff member has their desk set up, email established, business cards? Even introducing the new staff member to the other staff in the business and letting them know the safety aspects such as first aiders, fire wardens and emergency evacuation details are important. 

The onboarding process does make that new staff member feel welcome and part of your business team. It is through onboarding that employees learn how to meet the expectations of the company. By aligning new employees with their role, they feel needed and important in the organization. This helps them associate themselves with the workplace culture. ❤ 

What onboarding steps do you have in your business? How do you make new staff members feel welcome in your business?

"This is so true.

Some (most) job ads are so dull and boring and then hiring managers wonder why all the candidates aren't what they're looking for. 

It's such an endless cycle and it stops brilliant people applying for what could actually be a deeply fulfilling job, simply because it's not been sold to them properly.

"Why has there been a 60% increase in unfair dismissal claims reported to Fair Work Australia, compared to this time last year?

1. An obvious one - more dismissals and unemployment due to Covid-19.

2. Nervous employees seeking some financial security following dismissal given lower prospects for finding new employment.

3. Dodgy employers using Covid-19 as an excuse to terminate or abuse the Jobkeeper scheme.

What can 
hashtag
#Employers and 
hashtag
#HR people do to reduce the chance of a claim? 

1. As usual, there is a process to follow, stick to it!

2. Employers need to be transparent with their employees, giving them both good and not so good news. If there's a chance redundancies may occur in the future then employees need to be informed.

If employers don't have HR people and aren't sure of the process, they should seek assistance.

"Boris Johnson has said people who cannot work from home would now be encouraged to return to work - but they should avoid using public transport to get there if possible.

He wants people to drive, cycle or walk to work but he made NO mention of skateboards, pogo sticks, roller-skates or space hoppers. Read into that what you will! 

Mr Johnson mentioned construction and manufacturing as examples of industries which would now be explicitly encouraged to restart.

He also said that employers will receive guidance on how to become ""Covid secure"".

In advance of that, Robinson Ralph Limited is offering the following FREE resources for employers: 
 
• A guidance note on returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 
• A Workplace Social Distancing Policy.
 
If you would like a copy of either or both of these resources, please email info@robinsonralph.com.
 
These resources are intended for general information purposes only and do NOT constitute legal advice.

"What’s next? (Ctd)

So as we wait to hear from Boris (not the press) whether there will be more than garden centres opening, it has been reported that the government is considering introducing a legal right to work from home.  Apparently, employers will only be able to refuse it if the work cannot be done at home.  

I am an advocate for flexible work and it is fantastic that this crisis has probably pushed that agenda forward by 10 years in 10 weeks. Saying that, I am interested to see how this will be different to the current legal right to request to work flexibly.  It will now doubt give it some welcome publicity if nothing else.

It is worth remembering that this proposed legislation is not required for good and forward thinking employers to continue any practices which have ensured sustainability and business continuity during the Covid crisis.  What is required now is an employer with:
 • great leadership (courage, compassion,   clarity);
 • current HR & legal advice; and 
 • a mindset to learn and grow from this crisis.

Are employees really just an expense?  

Some updates are in order.

Any thoughts to share?

Thank you!

*Edit: Perhaps the simplest way of attributing asset value is the actual cost of the salary and benefits that an employee is paid.  Doesn't that indicate what the employer believes the employee's contribution is worth?

"A few thoughts when applying for any job at any organization:

1. Fill out the application completely. HR is going to swipe away your application in 3 seconds if it’s not. And why do 90% not to complete the other 10%. 

2. Make sure you answer any cultural questions. Don’t spend so much time giving answers to questions not asked. What HR wants to know is that you understand emotional intelligence and how to apply it.

3. Check your spelling. If you don’t take the time to proof your life’s greatest professional successes (on two pages), you may not take the time to make sure projects less important than your life are done right. 

4. Don’t just randomly apply for “anything”. Unless HR is desperate, which we are likely not, we’re not going to entertain applications that don’t tell us what you are really interested in and passionate about. And make sure the job that you are applying for actually exists (see photo). 

5. Want to do what the organization is doing and believe in the mission. Don’t show up and when asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how interested are you in the job say “8”. We don’t want you to not want to do your job 8 hours a week.

1) Process Simplification : It is very difficult to follow a complex process anywhere, and especially frustrating if you cannot ask Dave, why he had to put that extra note on the top !!  

2) Digitization :  Because, good luck with the logistics of paper based remote working

3) Automation : It is actually a subset of 2. And if nothing else, it could be a quick and easy link between your existing legacy system process and the new age collaboration tools.

4) Training : To be effective and efficient while working remotely needs a whole different set of soft skills.  

Allow more and more employees to work from outside offices - Be Location Independent

"When faced with confrontation, your mind tells you to avoid the situation at all costs. Flee it is. Everyone wants CONFLICT-FREE LIFE. 

Whereas CONFLICT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH. The best way to resolve conflict is to see it as an opportunity for growth. Growth has only one sure path and it is through conflict. 

Conflict is growth trying to find expression. CONFLICT MUST NEVER BE IGNORED OR AVOIDED: Conflict is not the problem, avoiding conflict is!

"It’s the start of new week, and with the woolly message of last night, HR, how are you feeling? What’s on your mind currently? What support do you need this week? What do you wish someone would ask you today? 

I’ve been saying forever that clarity is something we all need more of from our leaders, and last night we certainly didn’t get that - in my opinion! And a lack of clarity from leadership usually means a lot more work for HR in trying to translate messages and do the right thing for people. I’ve seen HR pushed to the limits in some cases over the last couple of months, please, please remember to take some time out for yourselves this week.

"A quick question people
is it really necessary to either place your staffs on redundancy or outright lay them off because of the COVID 19 crisis. i believe this is a phase that will pass sooner or later and the world order will go back to normal, economic activities will resume and businesses will start to flourish once again, then this organisations that has laid off diligent and dedicated employees will return to the HR market to fill those vacuums they created in a panic period. 
shouldn't we advice our management to either be patient or adopt pay-cut till all of these is over?.

"Running up to 2025, Tata Consultancy Services will ask a vast majority of 75% of its 4.48 lakh employees globally (including 3.5 lakh in India) to work from home, up from the industry average of 20% today. 
The new model called 25/25 will require far less office space than occupied today. ""We don't believe that we need more than 25% of our workforce at our facilities in order to be 100% productive,"" says TCS's chief operating officer N. G Subramaniam.

This could leave a great impact on other companies to follow the same working model.
Apart from the issue of maintaining social distance in offices till the pandemic is over or we find a vaccine, following can be the benefits to a company as well as employee:

The employees who have moved to the city in which their office is, they'll be saving on accommodation rent, food and travel expenses(if any) plus they can be with their families.

Whereas the companies will be saving a lot of money in maintaining office spaces and bearing travel expenses for the employees.

Feel free to add your thoughts.

Just came across this. May be useful for fellow students!
Very useful information regarding after lockdown practices for employers by Sejal Raja
"Robinson Ralph Limited are hosting a FREE webinar this Wednesday at noon called “Furlough and Redundancy”. 

“What’s it about fatty? Tell us now!” I hear you cry from your sofas.

Alright. Calm down. I was planning on telling you. You’re so impatient and rude. Be nice! 

The webinar will focus on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on employers and will explore what you need to be aware of should redundancies unfortunately become necessary.

By the end of the session you will know:

• the practical implications of COVID-19 on undertaking a redundancy process;

• the importance of collective consultation despite the logistical challenges presented by COVID-19; and

• the issues an Employment Tribunal will consider in claims for unfair dismissal.

Sounds riveting doesn’t it? 

What’s that you say? “No, it doesn’t. It sounds well boring”. I do wish you’d stop being so mean! 

Please click https://lnkd.in/g9Pdvag to register.

You’ll also receive a FREE employers’ information sheet which answers those questions which may be relevant in the coming weeks... and months.

We look forward to seeing you there!*

"Gartner identifies 9 trends broken into 3 categories... accelerating trends, new impacts, pendulum swings that will impact the Future of Work!"
"Organisations are now moving to the next phase of planning during the pandemic.

The impact of the virus has tested organisational and individual resilience to the full.

Attention is moving towards the gradual return of people to the workplace.

There are logistical plans and risk assessments to complete, but ultimately what we are dealing with is an exercise in human emotion.

Anybody who says they have not felt stressed or worried over the last couple of months is probably being disingenuous.

There will be a range of emotions for people to process on their return to work.  Some may feel relief, with the reassurance of returning to familiar routines.  For others, it may be fear.  Will my workplace be safe for me and others?  

Managers will need to demonstrate a healthy degree of emotional intelligence during the reintegration to work phase.  Reactions may vary, and there is never any substitute for open communication and sincere listening.  There is no single answer here, each person and each situation is unique.  

When considering new ways of working, the handling of emotional responses is likely to be the biggest factor in successfully supporting people back to work.  A genuine people first approach will be crucial.

"One of the subtle shifts that enable successful leaders to consistently grow and deliver strong performance through complex and difficult times is that they’ve stopped asking questions that begin with “How do I...?” and replaced them with “Who can help...?” When you do this over time, the sum total of ‘who you know’ becomes ‘what you know' (AND can get done quickly and effectively.)

With that in mind, it’s a privilege to be hosting these 6 leading experts on behalf of Travel Daily Media, to help leaders in the travel and hospitality space, navigate a new path forward during these unprecedented times. If you're interested in joining us and getting some valuable insights, see below for details, and please share with anyone you think might also benefit (seating is limited).

"""But when 
hashtag
#HR comes in to confine talent to boxes, to fit imagination into checklists, and to put the lid on enthusiasm, it all bursts into a violent clash of values: one that’s at the core of why companies rooted in tradition are struggling."" Never truer words spoken. 

And align this statement with the article appearing in The Australian today ""America appears near to major economic depression and social collapse, and this is now top of the list of dangers from COVID-19"", writes Alan Kohler. 

And hopefully the lessons to be learnt coming out of this period of uncertainty and the imbalances in this world today, will be to respect and empower every individual ""to feel free to show their passions both in and outside of work, to drive change by employing the full range of their talents, to express their curiosity and uncensored enthusiasm, (to enable them as) the ones best positioned to thrive in the future.""

"A thought:

When companies ask for “X years of experience in ___”, what are they really asking for?

To quote Iñigo Montoya, “I do not think it means, what you think it means”.

Companies want to attract experienced talent that can bring new ideas and innovation to the table. 

And yet when their job descriptions ask for “5 years experience in sales”, what they’re really saying is:

“We want one year of experience in sales, repeated 5 times”. 

What’s the value in that?

Don’t get me wrong, it is of course important to want applicants to have some degree of experience and/or knowledge in the subject matter of the job. 

But what about that person with 2 years experience in the role you’re hiring for, but 3 years in another role that would provide them with a different perspective and cache of knowledge? 

Personally, if I wanted a basket of fruit, I wouldn’t choose the one with 8 apples, but the one with 3 apples, 3 oranges, and 2 mangoes. 

I don’t think companies value diverse experience (experience in roles or industries that are not directly aligned with the job being posted) nearly enough, and with the proliferation of computers sorting through applications many candidates who could provide a huge value impact are being cast aside.

"Dr Allin-Khan hits the nail on the head. Again. This thread is superb. 

My own off the cuff thoughts...

1. Go to work if you have to but don't use public transport. This jeopardises everyone and probably the most vulnerable employees. And what about childcare? 

2. ""Some"" hospitality ""might"" open in July. So businesses cannot plan and remain entirely in the dark. 

3. Go out and about more than once a day but only with people from your household. This is an open invitation to the less responsible amongst us who are already pushing the boundaries. 

4. Some primary school years might go back in June. Who will be working out the mixed age school run protocols or dispensation for those parents who don't want to send their children back?

This pic is from my 1997 NYU graduation. 

I reflect on a lesson my mom taught me over and over again. 

Be kind to and help others. 

So I offer this to my

If I can help you with a connection, career advice, or just to listen, connect with me. Message me.

"Happy Mother’s Day! Mind-Body-Spirit Boost! 

Remember, physical fitness supports mental and emotional fitness and overall performance! 

Quick workout (no weight vest required )

-20 curls (with bands)
-20 shoulder presses (I go halfway due to limited mobility)
-20 Tricep extensions
-20 straight leg dead lifts 
-20 calf raises 
-10-4 count mountain climbers 

1 round takes around 3-4 min. 

Do as many rounds as you want.  

(After my rounds, I also added a set of 20 walking lunges at the end as a finisher.)

"What are the most effective selection methods to predict employees performance? 

According to the 85 years of research by Schmidt & Hunter, the top 3 selection methods with highest predictive power are work sample, General Mental Ability Test and structured interview. 

Surprisingly, years of job experience and reference checks proved less effective in predicting the job performance of candidates.

Recruiting may not be an option for many employers right now, but it's important to plan ahead and consider how this process will work once business as usual resumes.

We looked into this further with the help of Katrina Collier, founder of The Searchologist and HRD Thought Leader, exploring what leaders can do to recruit effectively post-pandemic. 🔎

"I remember one particular class during my MBA curriculum, where we were taught on  how important it is to communicate during the time of crisis. 

One of the highlights was to paint a real picture in-front of the employees and communicate with them any key decision that’s being made. 

Few days ago when I was reading about how

Even though there is no foolproof plan communicating lay-offs, i think

"Let’s talk about employee happiness 😁

Although money is a part of happiness, studies have shown that it’s not the main thing that determines employee happiness...💰

Here are the top 🔟 factors according to a Harvard Business Review study:

1️⃣ TRUST and RESPECT - from employers, colleagues and of course it must be reciprocated 😌

2️⃣ FAIRNESS - regardless of their rank, sex, gender, race or religious beliefs, all employees are human beings 🧕🏾👵🏼🤱🏾👬

3️⃣ They feel LISTENED to - we need to unlearn what we know about listening. We need to know how to actively listen to others 👂🏼

4️⃣ RELATIONSHIPS with colleagues 🤗

5️⃣ LEARNING and CAREER DEVELOPMENT - they want to progress in life, if they feel stagnant, there’s a good chance they’ll leave the company 🤓

6️⃣ FINANCIAL and JOB SECURITY ⛓

7️⃣ A WORK-LIFE BALANCE ⚖️

8️⃣ Interesting job CONTENT 📚

9️⃣ Company MORALE and VALUES 💎

🔟 Work APPRECIATION - do they find their work meaningful? 🧐


Happy employees = great ROI. Take a look at the image… 😳🤯

Can you think of other factors that influence employee happiness? Let’s start a conversation 👇🏼

"Employers asking for the Previous Base Salary for benchmarking is Unfair! 👇
 
Finally, somebody raising this important topic. I couldn't have said it better myself. Whoever came up with that rule is the Slave Master.  The previous base salary is irrelevant and is tantamount to locking candidates in poverty and amounts to further exploitation, what if one was underpaid in their previous employ!  I also strongly believe that Your Value Add Proposition determines your worth. It is what should set the stage for the wage proposal or negotiation not the last payslip!.
