"$50k - $150k

That’s the price headhunters charge for executive job search services. 

I know because I just read through 5 proposals that were sent to one of my new clients. ;)

Oh — Plus a 5% fee on the base salary.

You might think that’s shocking unless you make $500k - $1M.

At that level, the signing bonus alone could be worth 2, 3x that. That makes a move worth millions.

Now, let’s say you’re not quite there but you want to get there. 

You know that to do so you’ll need to make another move first. 

But how?
 
You’re busy. 
(**Executive women work 10 hours a day + Saturdays on average)
 
You probably haven’t looked for work in about 10 years. 

And those expensive professional clubs aren’t getting you there.
 
This isn’t about just a resume.
This isn’t about “applying”
This isn’t about what the other ""guys"" are doing.
 
This is about you.  What are you doing?

What do you believe about your worth?  

What’s the cost of avoidance and confusion?
 
What’s the cost of a messy, passive job search? 

Hint: The exec search firms know it's more than $50k.  
 
That’s why I created services and a community to support your move.

Whether that's a power move or a million-dollar move... Let's make it happen.

"Here's a new perspective older workers can learn from millennials.

Older workers grew up in a ""serial"" career paradigm. You gave your all to your one job and climbed the ladder, or jumped to another, higher rung on a different ladder. We didn't usually make too many changes, and ideally we would find a berth with the right company where we could grow and prosper.

Not anymore.  Cultivating the side gig isn't necessarily about having an ""out"" in case something goes wrong at the day job (although it serves that purpose). It's about having an entrepreneurial mindset. Your side gig enhances your reputation and helps you stand out. It provides an extra layer of dimension to your professional brand that adds value to the work your do in your day job.

For older workers, developing your side gig could help you hold onto your current job longer, as well as help you lay the foundation for your eventual second-act career.

"In the logistics field, in my case, it is crucial to understand how many orders or how much sales amount lay between ORDER DATE and SHIP DATE. If the order is processed, but not yet shipped out, then the cash is not flowing. The organization never can get the money from customers before ship out (in some cases, before final delivery). Because of this reason, a calculation to have the result of how many order numbers or sales amount lay between the two date columns has to be known and analyzed for the future plans.
I could write the below blog thanks to many trainers who publish videos about 
hashtag
#PowerBI on Youtube. The writing is about analyzing and visualizing the numbers that lay between the order date and ship date, and it is dynamically filtered by several variables.

"Are you Looking for an Internship? 
Comment ""Yes"" and send me a connection request. I will see your profile, get back to you and blah blah....

I see a lot of posts which reads just as above.

Some are taking advantage to increase their followers/connections using this means. I am sure no one has the time to review 3000+ profiles, right? 

What then could be a better approach to search for Interns through LinkedIn and how to test the genuineness of people posting these updates?

"Video Interviews
Treat it like a regular face to face interview
 
According to a report by software firm Jobvite 80% of recruiters use video for interviews, and 61% use video when screening candidates. Video interviews can understandably be challenging for job seekers. Some people just have a discomfort with being on camera. People feel conscious about how they look on video, or they’re worried about whether their technology is going to hold up. That's why it's important to work out the wrinkles before your interview. In these   times most businesses are operating remotely, the standards for hiring talent have not been relaxed.  The interviewing process is just as aggressive as it was, and it's not as easy when it's not in person, so be as prepared as you can.

"COVID-19 has taken so many people's jobs, internships.

Some will get other offers. 

Others may not. For them-a suggestion.

Why not spend the next week researching how you can build an income stream online?

I got a taste of this a few years back.

I started 3 niche websites over a 1 year period in 2017-18.

Those sites, built over the course of several weekends and early mornings before work, still make me some money every month even though I haven't touched them in well over a year.

In early 2018, I got bored with building niche sites and moved on to SEO consulting for some time. 

I helped other blog owners grow their website traffic and monetize it. 

With just ONE client, I would work 3-4 hours every weekend and earn more than I would at my day job all week.

The point of this isn't to brag.  

I want to point out that, regardless of your situation, the internet is full of opportunities. Use them.

And if you have the luxury of not worrying about money:

My projects taught me copywriting, content marketing, how to generate organic traffic, branding, monetization, and many other skills.

If I were on the job market, I wouldn't have to tell recruiters about my skills- I could just show them.

Why can't you do the same in your areas of interest?

"Episode 15 - Useful Post - Offer

(From Episode 10)
----------------------------
A short note on ATS
-ATS is a glorified word counter with some context
-Most ATS are very backwards
-Some show file names
-Puts unprepared applicants at a disadvantage

For beginners,
Jobscan is a website that helps analyze your resume and suggests changes. It includes specific information related to various ATS software. First, 3 scans are free. After this, it is paid and a bit expensive.
----------------------------

Use the link below to get 50% off jobscan.co

https://lnkd.in/gRDCdhJ

I have purchased it immediately
(50% off deal, before it used to 125~SGD, now 63SGD)

Current Spend for Job Search (🙄)
Jobscan- 4Months 63SGD -> about 15/month
+
LinkedIn- 20SGD for 2 Months & later 40/month
+
(""secret sauce"")

Just paying also doesn't get you a job. These are just tools.

Good Luck on your job search.

"“We are seeing a fundamental shift in the skills and leadership background required by companies. Companies that are affected the worst are looking to replace leaders that are failing to handle this crisis. Recruiters are also actively beefing up their lists of leaders proficient in dealing with crises, transitions, and virtual business. In addition to these skills, a savoir-faire in managing relationships and leveraging social capital outside of the traditional format is more prized than ever before.” said Dan Resendes, chief consulting officer at The Barrett Group in Julie Norwell article on CAREER MANAGEMENT AND THE NEW NORMAL WHAT WILL WORK LIFE AND JOB SEEKING LOOK LIKE AFTER THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS? https://lnkd.in/dQ78TTw

You're getting interviews for the roles you’re applying to.

If that’s not happening, one option is to get some professional, objective advice from someone like me...

I’m a CV writer, author and qualified accountant. I’d love to help you get an interview for a role you deserve, and there are two ways I can do that.

1 - You can send your current CV to me, and we can arrange for a one hour consultation. I will critically review your CV and talk you through my recommendations. You then work on those recommendations and update your CV. The cost for this is £99.

2 - You can choose to have me create a bespoke professional CV, specifically designed to highlight your unique strengths and skills. We have a detailed discovery call. I create your bespoke CV. We have follow-up calls to review and tweak your CV until you are completely satisfied. I also review and update your LinkedIn profile, based on your new CV. You have a fully aligned suite of personal branding documents. The cost for this is £395.

If either of these would work for you, drop me a message today.

"The #1 tip on how to list your references on your resume is to...

⛔ Just skip it! All it does is take up valuable space. If the recruiter wants to know your references, they’ll ask for it.

👍 The only case you’d want to include a list of references is when the job description explicitly asks for it. 

If that IS the case, here’s how each reference entry should look like:

➡️ First name, last name
➡️ Professional title
➡️ Name of the company
➡️ Business address
➡️ City, State, Zip
➡️ Phone number
➡️ Work E-mail

Do:
✔️ List your biggest fan first
✔️ Clarify your relationship

Don’t:
❌ Overshare
❌ Include personal information

For some real-life examples & tips on how to structure the References section, check out our full article in the comments below.

"The key to selling yourself in an interview?

Know what you're selling.

Where do you fit in their team? Are you the ""leader,"" the ""networking expert"", or are you the ""problem-solver.""

Establish who you are and how you'll benefit their company before you get to the interview. Brand yourself and stand out from the competition.

"When an unemployed person sends you a connection request on LinkedIn.

1. Accept their connection request.
2. Don't judge someone based on their job title.
3. Treat others as you would like to treated.
4. Help as you can. Like, share and comment on their posts.

Unemployment is temporary. Life is unpredictable. The person you reject today, you might need their help tomorrow. ""We rise by lifting others.""
Agree?

"0 TO 100, REAL QUICK...

You need to pay the bills. 
You want a fulfilling career. 
You live to make an impact.

You are versatile and valuable. 

You can make more money, save more money and save more time for any organization on the planet. 

BUT...

The number of interviews, offers and earnings you generate is contingent on 3 factors...

1) If you cannot quantify, articulate and differentiate your value on your resume, LinkedIn and during interviews, your options will remain limited.

2) If you are not engaging influential business leaders and empowered hiring managers, the right way, every day, your options will remain limited.

3) If you are not asking the right questions, discovering challenges, and presenting your growth solutions, your options will remain limited.

FACT...

If I were to review your strategy, content and execution, most of you would score below 10% (despite giving 100%).

That is why you feel helpless and depressed every time you get rejected for jobs and passed over for target promotions.

"This is not a basic post about the future of my career. Instead, I think it would be best to share the wisdom I accumulated after navigating a 10 month 
hashtag
#jobsearch in college. I hope something will resonate and help you.

Job searches are not fun. Mine seemed never ending and there were several instances where I was 100% certain I had a job - but was ultimately disappointed. 

1.) Keep learning. If you learn and improve from opportunities that didn't work out, you will be prepared for the one that will. 

2.) Network, network, network. I did not find my job at a career fair. I found it by putting myself out there and scheduling phone calls with people at companies and positions I could see myself in. Give it a try. 

3.) Find peace. Have an open mind. Don't stress about what you can't control. Control what you can control and let the process guide and teach you. You'll emerge with strength, wisdom and patience. 

After learning the 3 lessons above, I was finally prepared for the position I was meant to find! I have accepted a position with Bloomerang as an Account Associate! No matter how much I wanted it to, I'm blessed that my job search did not work out earlier because I would not have become who I am now. 

Also, apply for jobs in Harry's Chocolate Shop. I'm 1 for 1."

"I got a rejection email from Google.

I applied to be an engineer with them a couple of weeks ago.

It was, quite literally, the nicest rejection email I’ve ever received.

Other companies have sent me automated rejection emails with DO NOT REPLY listed at the top. Most companies didn’t even reply.

Meanwhile, Google

-sent an email from an actual person, not an automated response

-wished me and my loved ones safe

-encouraged me to keep applying and said they’d keep me in mind for other job opportunities

-offered to give me resources about roles I’d like to apply to and their hiring process

-encouraged me to reply if I had any questions about my application

If this is how they treat job applicants, I can only imagine how well they treat employees. I am confident that’s how they attract top talent and continue to dominate the world in technology.

"Hello Everyone,

I'm a entry level Data Scientist urgently looking for a job. I have recently completed an Internship as Machine Learning Engineer for 3 months. The condition now is very serious and I'm finding it difficult getting interview calls. I Have been posting for 2 weeks still no response. I have worked on various machine learning models, training, testing and deployment on Google Cloud Platform. I have also worked with technologies like tensorflow, TfLite, Google AutoML. I've also assisted in building search engines and recommendation systems. I'm attaching my resume with the links of all my projects. Please contact me if there is any opening. I'm willing to work full time or even as an intern. I can also work from home until the lockdown ends. If you have any openings please contact me or please refer to someone who has an opening. Please share this post so that it gets to the right person.

"Thank you to Career Coach and Author Ford Myers for joining the Philadelphia Area Great Careers Group (King of Prussia Chapter) to speak on “10 Vital Strategies to Maximize Your Career Search.” 

• you are responsible for your career, no one else is
• in job search, model the behavior of those who have found employment
• focus on your toolkit not just on your resume, toolkit includes items such as Accomplishment Stories, Target Company List, One Pager, LI profile, Letters of Recommendation...)
• build & maintain an active network, this is your most valuable career asset
• people negotiate when buying a house or a car but they don’t negotiate for a better salary 

What did you learn?

"As most of us are confined at home, we have more time to reflect and do things that we never had time to do. With this additional time we have on our hands, for those of us looking for work, it may be a good idea to go beyond the beaten paths and research our way into a job that fits our aspirations. Otherwise, we would be limiting ourselves to a very small segment of jobs available, and competing with many others for those same jobs. Sari Friedman shares her insights: https://bit.ly/3cu4pVZ

I studied with Julia in Dublin for 4 years. Recently, due to the Coronavirus outbreak, she has lost her job in the field of HR. 

Julia is the kind of person anyone would want on their team. Hard-working, intelligent, kind, fun and curious, with great problem-solving abilities. She even speaks 3 languages!

"Have you finally landed an interview for your dream job? Follow these 3 interview tips and nail it!

3 - STAND OUT. Find out your interviewer's name and look them up online! Follow their social media accounts and like-bomb them the day before your interview! (Bonus tip: The older the posts are, the better!)

2 - ACT NATURAL. You don't want to look like you're trying too hard, so put less work into your appearance than you usually would!

1 - BLEND IN. Learn about the main demographic applying for your position, and make sure you look the part! For example, interviewing at a coffee shop? Grow a beard! (Or, for the ladies, get a sleeve tattoo!)

GO ROCK THIS DAY.

"Don't forget to say Thank You!  

The importance of sending a Thank You note can't be over emphasized enough.  In fact, following up with a thank you could very well be the deciding factor between you and another equally qualified candidate getting an offer. 

Here are some common questions about thank you notes:

✅ When should I send a thank you?  Within 24 hours of your interview.  I suggest sending an email thank you the same day, and sending out a hand written thank you the same day as well so it arrives the next day.

✅ Should I send a thank you to everyone I met with in the interview?  YES.  Make sure you have their contact information including the correct spelling of their name.

✅ What should I include in the note?  Here is a great format: Show gratitude for the opportunity to interview, include something specific about the conversation, mention why you are excited and why you would be a great fit.  Include your contact information in your signature. 

I would love to hear from my colleagues that are hiring leaders! How important is sending a thank you note after an interview?  Has a thank you note ever helped you make a decision in your hiring process?  Comment below ⬇️
