"Sharing a video that made me overwhelm with emotions today  and thought to share few of my perspectives along with this video, that connects with our life:
hashtag
#Success is not a instant process: Nothing comes for free and it take years of efforts and hardships to earn you success. It‚Äôs you that determines your future.
hashtag
#Be focused on your goals. . It can be your career and a new job. . Your future studies. . May be your business. . Or let it be your family. Focus and resilience pave the way to your success. 

Hakim Ziyech is 
hashtag
#Dutch 
hashtag
#Football league player who used to play for Ajax FC and he have currently signed a new contract for 
hashtag
#Chelsea Football club. It was his final message to Ajax fans before moving to London. His struggles didn‚Äôt stop him. His family and mother was his focus. . And now he might be having whatever he wants in his life , but it his focus and hardwork that earned him success. His focus was his family and struggles of Mother. 

So set your target and fight. . We might fall but there will be people around you to lift you up and lead you to success. There is light even in the darkest of  night. 

Tomos Archer  I could connect this video with your words.

"Job Seekers Advice Tip Number 5.

When looking for your next role remember your skills are often transferable!  Don't restrict your search to sectors you have previously worked in - particularly relevant if you have experience in a regulated environment like Financial Services, Telco or Utilities.  This is especially (but not exclusively) relevant for Customer Experience candidates.

"If you lost your job this week, I feel your pain.

I was resigned in 2016 on the first day after my second maternity leave and on a financial crisis.

I was depressed, disoriented and feeling rejected for months.

When I recovered from my emotional downside, I discovered that there were companies which were not only doing well, but also hiring new employees.

It was a combination of heart and strategical thinking that put me back on the career path. And my instruments were my network, a therapist, a coach, linkedin and a great CV.

Today I recognize that resignation as a turning point in my life. The one that started a meaningful work track.

So if I may say something: embrace your feelings, don‚Äôt ignore them. When you feel ready, start your job seeking process. Use your strengths and repertoire to explore new possibilities.

"Dear Companies and Agencies,
Please remove JOB VACANCIES posted if you are currently not HIRING. It‚Äôs a complete waste of our time preparing and sending out resumes for ""phantom jobs."" Job searching is emotionally draining and this only gives us false hope. Leaving these postings up just to collect resumes is not cool. Put yourself in our shoes. Just be honest and transparent by letting us know you have frozen hiring. Only advertise for live jobs. Show empathy and respect and we look forward to one day to work for such an organization as yours.
 
Sincerely, 
Jobseekers

"The scariest lines I've ever read-

'Salary best in the industry' or 'Salary- no bar for right candidates' 

And when we finally discuss the salary- it's way lesser than what a candidate is already earning. Then, how is it best in the industry? Clearly not. 

If you as a company are afraid to mention the salary package, then you're definitely not looking for the best candidates.

"""Covid-19 problems require Covidlike solutions""
- An Aatmanirbhar Covidian

Definition of a Covidian - ""The one who has lost his job during Covid-19 crisis because a stupid Microbe got Viral""

Covidian is not just a term, not just a single person. But it's a community, it's a league, it's about all those highly passionate but struggling Job-hunters.

In my desperate attempt to address the challenges faced by Covidians, here's a brief Professional Persona of a Covidian.

This is a post by a Covidian, for all the Covidians, to help the Covidians.

Request everyone to make it as Viral as possible, just like Covid-19 üòÇ

Cheers to all the Covidians ‚úåÔ∏è

 The Job Man Mad Over Marketing (M.O.M) Naukri News  Job Alert iimjobs.com"
"Our seniors have taught us...
There is no issue or problem in accepting the 
hashtag
#facts...

sharing some 
hashtag
#linkedin facts (my personal observation though :)

Linkedin is floating with...

1. 
hashtag
#Layoffs news
2. 
hashtag
#jobseekers prayers to get a job ( Very few to help them though)
3. Every Pandemic creates an opportunity.. so as the Layoffs 
hashtag
#Resume writers have overshot the number of 
hashtag
#jobs available on this platform :) ( Fact so accept it). 
5. The Linkedin 
hashtag
#job board is full of inactive jobs (But Irony of the fact is Jobseekers are still applying). Brigette Hyacinth has already raised this issue a couple of days back.
6. Jobseekers can also have them enrolled for INR 499 or INR777 ( there are many different price points available in the market, created by some 
hashtag
#product superheroes) to learn how to use Linkedin to grow network & get a 
hashtag
#job ( as reminders, reader of this point can again go back & read point no- 5)
7. If all the above has already been tried & tested :)... then we have the Linkedin's decade-old remedy... there are posts which says, just comment ""HI"" or ""YES"" or ""Interested"" to get a job...

If anyone here looking for a job change, don't put any like on this post or comment...
Just simply write an email to me, I will try my best to help for FREE (email ID on the first comment)."

"As job seekers, we highly emphasize on attaching that professional prefix/suffix with our names. Well, it is important too. The credentials of a person in general increases, with those degrees associated with the name. If we don‚Äôt know a person personally, we automatically turn to the person with higher education first for the work

Degrees are the hoisting flags that initiate the run, other skills, technical as well as soft skills are the path to the ultimate destination. While degrees are the entry to that interview room, our skills are entry to the company door. So as much as earning a degree is important, it would be a sheer waste of that degree without the relevant skillset

We all have a dream company to work and grow with. With so much competition and given the current situation, it is difficult to get a job and sustain it. Getting into my final year of graduation, I have started looking for job roles at some of the companies, I aspire to work with. LinkedIn and other HR pages provide similar JD as well as skill requirement for the job. I look and introspect if I have those skills in me. If not, I plan and try to learn those and more

This is one way, I am trying to improve myself, how are you working for that ‚Äúdream job‚Äù?

"Have you lost your job due to COVID-19?


Here's some advice on how to handle your job search:

Apply for jobs, but ensure you tailor your resume for each application, based on the job description and don't just send the same resume to anyone and everyone hoping for a positive reply.

A normal resume is not going to cut it anymore. Screenings will take place at the resume stage itself and you may not be called for a video interview. You need to stand out from the competition. To do this, personalize your resume for every company that you apply to.

One piece of advice I have found helpful from a professor of mine, is to scrap out unnecessary sections from your resume and instead focus on the following details -

-What does the organization do?

-Your capabilities, talents and skills

-How does it fit in with the mission of the company?

-How can you create a revenue source for the company?

In times like these, companies would want to focus on their revenue and profits so that they can stay afloat, and every addition to their headcount will have to be justified.

Do you have any other tips for job seekers?
