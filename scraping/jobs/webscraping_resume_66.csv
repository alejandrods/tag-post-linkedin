"You know what I want?

Feedback.

I‚Äôm tired of receiving ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry to inform you we‚Äôre not moving forward with your application.‚Äù

It makes me question whether my resume was ever even read.

If a company told me, ‚ÄúWe decided to move forward with a different candidate who has more coding experience‚Äù or something then I could work off of that to improve my skills and my resume.

And I‚Äôm confident companies would receive applicants who are excited to work for their company and turn into great employees. Great employees work where they feel appreciated and fulfilled.

"Your resume shouldn't ""boldly go where no man has gone before.""

All the work you did on your resume and you're getting zilch.

You might as well have sent it to outer space somewhere. 

If that's you, you'll want to check out a free on-demand video resource. 

I'll walk you through step by step how to format your resume to get through ATS (the pesky Applicant Tracking System) and give you a resume template you can download.

The videos are short, helpful and you'll have lifetime access in case you ever want to refer back. 

Get access, get through the system and start getting seen by human eyes.

"Sharing the words of Google recruiter Elizabeth Morgan:

""At an old company I volunteered to greet candidates when they came in for onsite interviews. I'd give a quick tour, make them coffee, take their coats, etc. I LOVED getting to know people and easing their interview nerves.

""One leadership candidate came in and before I could even introduce myself, they handed me their coat and asked me for a water. It made me feel so small and uncomfortable.

""After they left for the day I sat in on the hiring team conversation like I always did. Our leadership team was REALLY excited about this person. 

""I decided to bring up my interaction with the candidate and the energy in the room grew somber. Other folks started talking about how they also noticed the candidate gave off (on several occasions) red flags about their ability to be a team player. Within 5 minutes this candidate had gone from an IN THE BAG HIRE, to‚Ä¶ let's call them tomorrow to let them know we won't be moving forward. 

""There's so much that goes into a hiring decision. Your interview starts the moment you share your resume. Be aware of how your actions come across and how the company responds to them; it just may be the reason they don't move forward with you or YOU decide they aren't for YOU! :)""

Anybody i have worked with who will need my assistance as well please come through. This act of kindness has to go onüëå.

#Jobsearch is not an easy task we understand but you should always keep some this in your mind while actively looking for a job:

1. Patience
Don‚Äôt stress out if you are not getting the required profile. Panicking will definitely ruin everything so be patient, your hard work will pay off.

2. Rejections
Rejections are a part of a job search and you should face it. Many people don't have the courage to face them and move forward towards their goals. 
Rejection will make you strong and confident as you will be well-experienced with personal interviews.

3. Keep Learning
Learning things will make you more knowledgeable and will help you stand out. Knowledge is never wasted. If it is not used in interviews it will definitely be helpful in the future.

4. Networking
Network! This is the best thing you should do while searching for a job. It will not only help you to get a new job but also you can showcase your skills to the ecosystem.

For Gatsby and other React projects I have come to like Netlify for hosting. You get advanced stuff like a

#aws S3 + CloudFront for free or close to it.

If anyone likes this and would like help to edit and personalize their fork as well as deploying it. Let me know in the comments below and I will write up a better readme file and deployment guide over the weekend.

"Hello Everyone,

I hope you and your family are safe during these crisis. 

I have spent my last 10 Years working with Students, College‚Äôs, Universities, School‚Äôs around the country. I have always truly loved helping student‚Äôs take their next step and helping them prepare for their careers, while helping college‚Äôs & universities I have the tools & trade for recruiting & counseling students for International Education.  

Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was laid off with no estimated date for when things may return to normal. I am open to any possible positions at this time, I would love to continue working within the international education field at any level. I appreciate any leads that anyone may have for any position that may be open or any company that may still be hiring during these testing times.

Please let me know if you have any opportunity/opening which I can be a good fit for or if you can help me connecting with the hiring team/recruiters. Kindly help in order to reach out to maximum people who may have been looking for potential candidates for the relevant roles of my expertise.

"A lot of my friends who had offers are getting laid off or offers are getting revoked, putting them back in the job market.
I just conducted a mock coding interview for one of them and it was a lot of fun and I'd like to do more, because I want to help other people and it helps me get a better idea of what the interviewer wants. So if anyone here wants to do a mock interview (either as the interviewer or interviewee) shoot me a DM and we can figure something out. My main languages are Java and Python but I can basically interview you in any language you want.

"You have listed a third language in your resume?


I had a unique experience today being interviewed by CityRecruit Recruitment Co. The interviewer noticed that I had listed Japanese language in my resume. So, the interview went something like this:

Interviewer: ""You have an elementary proficiency in the Japanese language? Have you taken the JLPT test before?"" 

Me: ""Yes, I have a basic understanding of the language.  Unfortunately, I have not sat for the JPLT test before. However, I did take Japanese in my SPM and studied it again in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTPOfficial).""

Interviewer: ""I see. So, can you introduce yourself in Japanese?""

Honestly, I was surprised. Speak Japanese in a job interview?Never experienced it before! Immediately, I spoke in Japanese with all the ""karat"" knowledge that I have. I spoke confidently and didn't bothered much about making few grammatical mistakes. I believe that he must be proficient in Japanese as he understood what I was saying. New achievement, unlocked!

So, friends! Especially the fresh graduates, let's be wise to prepare ourselves beforehand for the ""foreign language"" that we have listed in our resume. 

Have you encountered a similar situation like this before? Share your thoughts!

"HAPPENING RIGHT NOW: Resume 101 with Bank of America. Our volunteers, Roberto Hernandez and Kristin Tassini, are helping PENCIL students understand the basics of a resume. 

More than 70% of the 100 students who are attending the workshop have never made a 
hashtag
#resume before. 

Some interesting points made by our volunteers about whether or not to include 
hashtag
#hobbies and 
hashtag
#interests in your resume: 

Kristin: ""It's actually my favorite part of the resume, especially because business resumes can be simple, and this section really adds personality to the document.""

Roberto: ""Michael Jordon can be the best basketball player in the world but that's not all he does. This section is what makes you ""you."" It gives us something to talk about and I want to know if I'll enjoy working with you."" 

PENCIL Pro tip: things that you can include in your interests are drawing, gardening, traveling, playing the piano and more.

"Reminder to job seekers: The first person to read your application and resume is, in all likelihood, not in your profession or department, before it even gets to the hiring manager. 

Bear that in mind, to avoid technical language, acronyms, or super specialized jargon. What might seem like a very logical jump from your experience to the job, may not be obvious to a recruiter. We try our hardest to learn about the industries and skill sets for which we recruit, but do not live and breath it like you do every day. This greatly increases your odds of getting your resume past the initial round of screening! Not sure what is implied and what you should spell out? Ask a Recruiter.

At the start of the school year, I would spend countless hours applying to 
hashtag
#jobs in hopes that at least one company would consider me. But as the 
hashtag
#rejection emails piled up, the words ‚ÄúThank you for applying‚Äù translated to ‚Äúyou are not worthy enough‚Äù. 

However, I did not give up.

In February, I finally received an email for an 
hashtag
#interview. I made detailed notes on my 
hashtag
#resume to bring up during the interview to tie my 
hashtag
#skills directly to the role. A couple days later, I was ecstatic to get an offer at Ripple Foods as a R&D Intern during the semester. I wanted to personally thank Laura, Rogelio, and my other coworkers for mentoring and making me feel well integrated into the company.

Trying to get your foot in the door may be difficult, but maintaining a 
hashtag
#positive paradigm and having confidence in yourself is key. There is no definite timeline that you have to follow. Use each 
hashtag
#setback as a learning opportunity on how to improve and 
hashtag
#invest it back into yourself. 

One of my favorite quotes by Helen Hayes reminds us that, ‚ÄúAn expert at anything was once a beginner‚Äù."
"Here is a solid list of 
hashtag
#resumetips for all 
hashtag
#jobseekers :

1. One of the most looked for component of your resume is your professional summary. 
2. Your professional summary should highlight your value proposition to the company, your 
hashtag
#corecompetencies and some soft skills required for the job. 
3. The first line makes most of the impact so it should tell the 
hashtag
#recruiters  why are you important for them. 
4. Use adjectives like accomplished, constructed, delivered, influenced, established, optimised in the professional summary.
5. Spend adequate time to design your summary to attract recruiters and it should be tailor-made for every application.
6. Please follow the 
hashtag
#ats format if you are applying through job portals to reach the desired place.  
7. Should not more than more than 3-5 lines. 

Recruiters only take 7 seconds to screen each resume. So you have to take a great deal to be worthy enough of getting selected in those 7 seconds. 
 If you want my help with your resume I wold love to help you out. Please comment below and I'll get back to you.

"Our seniors have taught us...
There is no issue or problem in accepting the 
hashtag
#facts...

sharing some 
hashtag
#linkedin facts (my personal observation though :)

Linkedin is floating with...

1. 
hashtag
#Layoffs news
2. 
hashtag
#jobseekers prayers to get a job ( Very few to help them though)
3. Every Pandemic creates an opportunity.. so as the Layoffs 
hashtag
#Resume writers have overshot the number of 
hashtag
#jobs available on this platform :) ( Fact so accept it). 
5. The Linkedin 
hashtag
#job board is full of inactive jobs (But Irony of the fact is Jobseekers are still applying). Brigette Hyacinth has already raised this issue a couple of days back.
6. Jobseekers can also have them enrolled for INR 499 or INR777 ( there are many different price points available in the market, created by some 
hashtag
#product superheroes) to learn how to use Linkedin to grow network & get a 
hashtag
#job ( as reminders, reader of this point can again go back & read point no- 5)
7. If all the above has already been tried & tested :)... then we have the Linkedin's decade-old remedy... there are posts which says, just comment ""HI"" or ""YES"" or ""Interested"" to get a job...

If anyone here looking for a job change, don't put any like on this post or comment...
Just simply write an email to me, I will try my best to help for FREE (email ID on the first comment)."
"Great job Brett Iredale and JobAdder

""The results are in.  Over 700 recruitment agency owners and leaders responded to our survey, looking at the impacts of the coronavirus on the recruitment industry. A huge thank you to everyone who participated.  

Here are a few of the things we learned;

43% of recruitment leaders expect to start hiring again in 2020.

66% plan to implement flexible working from home options after restrictions are eased.

28% say that their team communication has IMPROVED during Covid-19 (weirdly, we have found the same at JA).

30% have experienced mental health issues during this pandemic.

59% are highly, or cautiously optimistic about the future.

"While the management of benefits and compensation is a given for human resources, the globalization of companies has meant that HR must now adapt to new ways of providing benefits to an organization's employees. 

Non-traditional benefits such as flexible working hours, paternity leave, extended vacation time, and telecommuting are ways to motivate existing employees and to attract and retain new skilled employees. 

Balancing compensation and benefits for the organization's workforce is an important HR function because it requires a sensitivity to the wants and needs of a diverse group of people.

"Hello LinkedIn and the community, 

During these tough times that we have all been facing, job search has become a lot of people‚Äôs high priority. In such a situation, every minute counts and every minute wasted would have been great to be put into something more productive. You agree? 

Here is an idea I had for LinkedIn, what if there is another filter in the job search which says ‚ÄúWork Authorization‚Äù? Me and a lot of my friends have faced this problem where we spend time to look at the jobs which match our profile, spend some time to apply for the job, spend some time to schedule a meeting with the recruiter via LinkedIn, talk to the recruiter and finally after all this efforts, we get to know that the profile doesn‚Äôt accept our work authorization or visa status. This process takes ~30-60mins per job and finally, there is disappointment. We now repeat the same process till we find the right match. 

Adding a work authorization filter in LinkedIn for both Recruiters and the candidates which would filter out most of the un-matching profiles and would let us spend our time on better profiles and end up in the job sooner than later?

"Very powerful reminder for everyone: you are not your resume/titles.
 
This concept that you are defined by ""three bullet points"" on your resume is outdated. When it is all said and done, no one will care about that ""prestigious transaction"" you closed or where you worked. What will matter, though, is whether you were a kind person and treated people nicely.
 
Triston Francis brings up the book ""The 100-Year Life ‚Äì Living and Working in an Age of Longevity"" by Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton which redefines how we should think about our careers.
 
The average 8-year old has a greater chance of living to 105 years and this has tremendous implications for how we should view work/life balance.
 
What is your take on work/life balance especially during quarantine?

"Review your resume for your industry
When crafting your resume, you might study your industry properly before applying on that 

Three main takeaways are:

Make it simple and easy to read: 
Resume samples are simple and straightforward. This is because employers have a minimal amount of time to review your resume, so readability is key. This also means selecting a professional, clean font.

Make it brief: 
You‚Äôll notice that each section of the resume sample is short and to-the-point, including the summary and experience descriptions. Including only the most key and relevant information means employers are able to consume more information about you, and more quickly understand your fitness for the role.

Include numbers: 
Numbers allow them to better understand the value you may bring to the position. For example, one bullet point under the experience description for an administrative assistant reads, ‚ÄúExecuted processing of vendor contracts and implemented a standardized process, reducing contract discrepancies by 90%.‚Äù

"While technicality is a great part of any job, the personality of every member of the company may enhance the quality of the projects substantially.
Be it a human or a machine scanning your resume, the target metrics are often similar; school prestige, GPA, and test scores are still top filters, however, the validity of using these factors to screen candidates has been called into question.

In the process of job hunting, I found 
hashtag
#Pymetrics, a platform where it will describe your cognitive and emotional results while also will compare it to the general population. This is what you cannot find in a 
hashtag
#resume, and in my opinion, this is what recruiters should look deeper into!

What use is it to live in the age of big data and 
hashtag
#machinelearning if we are not taking advantage of the potential developments??

"Helping hands to find you your next job
Resumesending is a resume distribution platform ‚Äì SO WHAT?

I can save you time and money finding a job
Let me prove the numbers and show you how I saved you at least $941.

To find and then register an account with 180+ job boards would take you at least 100 hours of your time. Time is money as they say.

Let‚Äôs say, for example, you value your time at $10 an hour as an absolute minimum. Your cost in time alone would be 100 hours X $10 or $1,000 of effort.

Resumesending will register you with 180+ job boards for only $59 plus your resume can be accessed by over 250,000 hiring managers and recruiters.

We even give you your own email system on the platform to track opportunities and to get job alerts from job boards and recruiters.

We think this is a great deal. Let us do the hard and boring work for you by registering your resume. All you have to do is open your emails, apply for and then get the job.

"Why is virtual hiring the new normal?

1) We are stuck together in a situation where staying at home is the most essential thing. 

2) Amidst this situation many people are still searching for various job/internship opportunities and virtual hiring by companies is making it done.

3) Even in this current situation employers are able to connect with their potential employees by means of Skype, zoom etc.

4)Due to the pandemic we all have to stay indoors for quite a long time. Virtual hiring is helping both job seekers and recruiters to carry on with their work without any hindrance.

5) Virtual hiring helps the job seekers to crack the jobs while they are in their comfort zone.

In the situation that is going on, will virtual hiring and work from home be the new normal?

"Ways to help your friend or colleague who's been laid off:
-Tell them you want to help! People don't want to assume, so make sure they know you want to help.
-Write them a LinkedIn Recommendation (as long as you can speak to their professional skills).
-Share resources, like The Job Sauce's free resume review https://lnkd.in/gc8QQEF
-Offer to make intros. In the job search world, getting referred is the best strategy.

"Hi everyone!

Unfortunately, I am one of many students this summer who received news that my in-person 10-week summer Assistant Buyer Internship with Ross Stores, Inc. was cancelled due to 
hashtag
#covid19. While this was initially very disappointing, the good news is that Ross Stores, Inc. has created a virtual, one-week internship program. I will have the unique opportunity to learn from Ross Stores' merchants, planners and business leaders, and will complete a case study to present to Ross Stores, Inc. leadership!

I'm hoping to leverage my network to learn about summer opportunities and open positions. I'm entering my senior year at the Fashion Institute of Technology studying fashion business management, with experience in wholesale and buying.

I am currently seeking a 10-week summer internship opportunity, and am interested in Buying, Planning, Wholesale and Merchandising roles. If you are aware of any summer 2020 opportunities, I would love to get in touch! I would also appreciate a like/comment and share of this post!

Thank you all, and stay safe!

All the best,
Chelsea Davis

"It is shocking to hear that 
hashtag
#recruiters reject a 
hashtag
#resume under 30 seconds and shamelessly boast about it. Who are these foolish recruiters, are they doing it on their own or follow an SOP / checklist created by their organization? Are we in some form of rat race to select only the Best of the Best? If that's the case, what happens to the second and third string of candidates? 

A 
hashtag
#jobseeker can spend 30 minutes / 30 hours / 30 days to create or update their resume. But it takes just 30 seconds for some recruiters to reject even the best of resumes. Imagine those who have decades of experience and have to shrink their portfolio to a single page or two pager. It's like reducing the font size to 5 or less to force the recruiter to zoom and read the resume. I don't know if we have to blame this on ML, AI, or organizational 
hashtag
#recruitment expectations! 

In my experience where recruitment was one of the roles, I have always given a minimum of 5-10 minutes to read and understand a profile irrespective of the number of pages, format and grammar, typos even if it is bad, and then decide whether to screen the candidate for the next round. 

Thankfully due to 
hashtag
#Covid19, recruiters are now hopefully showing little more sensitivity about the way they treat a resume even if it is the worst."

"While you might have extensive work or educational experience, it‚Äôs important to keep your resume as brief as possible without leaving out key information. Hiring managers don‚Äôt spend a lot of time reading each resume. Research has shown that hiring managers tend to spend only 6 seconds per resume. If your resume includes old or irrelevant information, such as jobs held over 10 years ago or minor degrees and achievements, it may distract from key information.

Try to include only work experience, achievements, education and skills most relevant to the employer. You can find the most relevant attributes by closely reading the job posting. You should prioritize important information higher on your resume to draw attention to key skills and achievements.

"This quote makes me laugh, ""Has your knight in shining armour, turned out to be a loser in aluminum foil?""  GRIN.  
There's a business spin on that quote.  I wrote about it in my book, ""Hired!  How To Get The Zippy Gig.  Insider Secrets From A Top Recruiter.""  It's in the chapter on ""How To Resign Like A Pro."" A reminder to resign with grace and professionalism and to never burn a bridge.  You never know if you'll someday want to return to that company or need them as a reference.  

Hope you get as much of a chuckle out of this image as I did!  :-)

"Are you a premium 
hashtag
#product?

Yes, I am talking about you, Fresher's.

Yesterday, I have been thinking while learning about ""
hashtag
#Quality"" and suddenly this struck my mind :
hashtag
#Fresher's are like those products which 
hashtag
#Customers (
hashtag
#Recruiting companies) wanna buy (hire) after a thorough inspection of quality attributes (desired skill set).

You wanna 
hashtag
#satisfy your customer then you must do these:

‚óèKnow your 
hashtag
#Unique Selling Proposition (why they should hire you?)

‚óèTell about 
hashtag
#competitive advantage which you are gonna offer ( In what ways you will benefit the company?)

‚óèKnow the customer(Company) 
hashtag
#requirements and conforms your 
hashtag
#standards(Skill set)

‚óèYou maintain your standards(integrity) and higher quality(wider skill set) and you can be a 
hashtag
#premium product(Higher 
hashtag
#Salary Package)

Think of these points while you prepare your 
hashtag
#Resume and getting ready for an 
hashtag
#Interview. This will definitely help you getting placed in good company with good

"I have been taking classes on Edx, Codecademy, and Coursera over the past few years. They are truly awesome and affordable platforms, and are gradually helping me change my career path. I can't say enough how grateful I am towards them."
"Everything in our hiring process is a parameter for choosing the right candidate - from application to their communications and appearance.
 
Some of the strategies we use are:

We test them for character ‚Äì Character is necessary, especially for team success. During interviews, we lookout for character. Granted, we may not be able to capture 100% character but tiny fragments usually become evident during our interactions with them

We look for skills and talents ‚Äì We evaluate talent, not resumes. Many experienced candidates only look good on paper. We test them on skills they claim to possess, and on tasks, they claim to have accomplished. We ask questions to determine the role they played in each task.

We try to understand what they're really looking for - Everyone wants to get paid, but no matter the amount of money they receive monthly, being on the wrong job is never going to make anyone happy. We ask questions to understand what makes them tick. To understand what makes each candidate tick, you have to test them on it, We try to understand why they left their previous jobs

"While going through the links provided by one of the job/ interenship pages, I came across the application link of McKinsey & Company  for internship.

To my amaze, while uploading my resume to the application, it asked the access to my Google account, i.e., access to all my files and mails (as shown in the pictures).

Apologies if I could not understand the privacy policy of the company but Security Concerns always lurk when such access is asked. Uploading resume directly would have been much acceptable.

There's also a possibility of decietful activities and fake links provided by these pages. I guess no company would ask for such access. It's very difficult for students who are desperately looking for internships to cater this problem. I suggest job seekers to be a bit more conscious of fraud links and sites.

Correct me if I'm wrong or missed out something. Any suggestions, opinions or feedback from your side is appreciated.

"During these strange times, I have heard from mentees and colleagues who are early in their careers and worried about what the current economic state will do to their resume and how it will hold them back. I agree with everything Mr. Daron K. Roberts, J.D. says here and sincerely appreciate the vulnerability this takes to share. At some point - We are all rejected, We all experience setbacks, We all have to pivot our idea of success. It's hard to see when you're in it, especially if you're new to the workforce and haven't been exposed to the loss of control that comes with being at the mercy of others' decisions. I love the idea of a rejection resume as a reality check because life is rarely as it seems.

"It was a well spent night with 40 young talents from different universities in 4 different countries. Thank you everyone who joined us in the Virtual Career Workshop last night.

We shared with them about the topics of Resume Writing, Cover Letter and LinkedIn during the 2 hours session. It was an interactive session where everyone were constantly asking questions. The session went slightly more than 2 hours.

This workshop was set to help all job seekers, fresh graduates and university students to prepare themselves before employment. Hope that they had gained valuable knowledge from the session.

It was the 12th Career Workshop from DR Resume Services and we had received 100% positive feedbacks from the participants. Thank you!

Due to overwhelming response from the participants, Sunday and Wednesday's session were both fully registered. DR Resume Services decided to organise a Final Session of Virtual Career Workshop to all job seekers.

Final Session of Career Workshop will held on:
Date: 16th May 2020 (Saturday)
Time: 3pm-5pm
Venue: Zoom

Registration URL: https://lnkd.in/gNeV7-z

Kindly register yourself earlier as there are limited of seats, this is the last session in May.

Hope to see you all!

"Why is virtual hiring the new normal?

1) We are stuck together in a situation where staying at home is the most essential thing. 

2) Amidst this situation many people are still searching for various job/internship opportunities and virtual hiring by companies is making it done.

3) Even in this current situation employers are able to connect with their potential employees by means of Skype, zoom etc.

4)Due to the pandemic we all have to stay indoors for quite a long time. Virtual hiring is helping both job seekers and recruiters to carry on with their work without any hindrance.

5) Virtual hiring helps the job seekers to crack the jobs while they are in their comfort zone.

In the situation that is going on, will virtual hiring and work from home be the new normal?

"How to write a stunning 
hashtag
#CV, elegant and easy to read! 

It is clear to me that good schools and great experience are often not related to a higher chance of getting a job interview. Even a cover letter sometimes does not help, and you question yourself why I did not get at least an interview with that company? My skills matched the job description!

Most of the companies do not even ask anymore for a cover letter during the first stage of recruiting process. So everything depends on how you sell yourself with your CV. It is key to write a short CV (max 2 pages!), well presented, tailored to the job description and easy to read! You might have great experience but if your CV is not catchy enough the hiring manager will be bored after reading 2 lines and will switch to the next candidate. Yes, because they have probably hundreds of applicants and they cannot waste time in understanding your CV.

I came across a code edited by Nick Strayer, I modified it and created an R package (fairly) easy to use for beginner R programmers. Stunning and elegant layout that will make your CV look great! The attached CV is created with the 
hashtag
#cv R-package (link below) that is based on the 
hashtag
#pandoc

#resume template.

"Why is virtual hiring the new normal?

1) We are stuck together in a situation where staying at home is the most essential thing. 

2) Amidst this situation many people are still searching for various job/internship opportunities and virtual hiring by companies is making it done.

3) Even in this current situation employers are able to connect with their potential employees by means of Skype, zoom etc.

4)Due to the pandemic we all have to stay indoors for quite a long time. Virtual hiring is helping both job seekers and recruiters to carry on with their work without any hindrance.

5) Virtual hiring helps the job seekers to crack the jobs while they are in their comfort zone.

In the situation that is going on, will virtual hiring and work from home be the new normal?

"Keeping a resume ready, with most of the content in place from the first year itself just makes it easier to add experiences later, as you gain them.

Though it seems futile to write a document where you need to enlist your experience when you don't have any actual experience, it gives me a sense of the things that I can do in the near future. That‚Äôs where an Internship Resume comes in picture.
 
So, I encourage all my first-year friends and batch mates to build their resumes from this moment itself, if you haven‚Äôt started already. This will be very helpful when you apply for internships later.
 
Also, Thanks to Abhishek Kateliya for teaching me the importance of building a resume and a LinkedIn profile from the start, without which I wouldn‚Äôt be sharing this right now!

Feel free to view the resume that I have created as a part of this course, on my Profile!

‚úÖWe met over 10 years ago. 
‚úÖAnkit originally reached out looking for opportunities in the US. 
‚úÖI wasn‚Äôt able to help him immigrate but I did give him an opportunity to join my team and work remotely. 
‚úÖOver the years he became a key part of the team and is now my right hand man. 
‚úÖWe would talk everyday creating needed recruiting, coaching and back office strategies. 
‚úÖSeveral years ago he was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer. With the help of his family, friends and myself, we raised enough money for his surgery.  He‚Äôs been 100% healthy ever since. 
‚úÖIn September 2019 he finally got his visa and for the first time in 10 years we met.

Don‚Äôt stop at a single apply on the career board and hope for the best. Stand out from others by getting to know everyone you can from department execs, heads, VP‚Äôs even C-suite! Ask the right questions and find out how they can help you work towards making it happen (some folk you‚Äôll speak with in these companies are financially motivated to refer/help you too).

"[Business Insight: How to write a resume that stands out]

If you want to apply for a desired job, you have to craft a resume first. There are lots of conflicting recommendations on the internet and they may make you confused. Should you keep your resume to one page? Do you need to include personal interests? Let‚Äôs see what the experts say. 

1. Open strong
The first 15-20 words of your resume are critically important, start with a brief summary of your expertise. 

2. Be selective
A resume is a very selective body of content, it‚Äôs not meant to be comprehensive. Only include experience that is relevant for the job. 

3. Share accomplishments, not responsibilities
What targets you have achieved for your previous companies are more attractive than just share what you have done in the past jobs. Try to give tangible and concrete examples of your accomplishments.

"Amid this 
hashtag
#lockdown, I have encountered many 
hashtag
#posts by various 
hashtag
#startups regarding 
hashtag
#internships mostly unpaid. they are posting it as if they are the 
hashtag
#lifesavers in no man's land and are working very hard to rescue the 
hashtag
#careers of the students especially first-year 
hashtag
#MBA 
hashtag
#graduates as they are frightened that their 
hashtag
#resume will look bad for final 
hashtag
#placements.
But let me tell you the harsh truth of this time, they are utilizing this 
hashtag
#COVID-19 as their opportunity to get free labor from these students who are trying there best to get themselves enrolled in some internship programs. They are exploiting the 
hashtag
#students like hell, breaking all the code of conduct.
It's my sincere request to all first-year MBA students not to worry about their internships as the 
hashtag
#industry is well aware about the current situation and like you there are many others.
So just keep calm and stay safe. Don't get lured by those so-called guarding angels.
All those startups should use this situation to focus on building trust in the market or on the 
hashtag
#growth opportunity, not as an 
hashtag
#opportunity to exploit. Because one day these MBAs will be your client working in different companies.

P.S:- Any suggestions or comments are highly welcomed

"Hi everyone, 

Just wanted to offer my help as we go through this time together. It's heartbreaking to see the number of talented people in the global workforce get laid off during these times. 

Here are a couple of fantastic platforms for my Aussies out there that have been built in response to this:

üê£ Hatch - If you're an Australian employer or employee and your employment has been affected by COVID-19, check out their COVID Exchange Program 
üí± Tier One People - If you're working in fintech and your employment has been affected by COVID-19, check out their Fintech Talent Community on LinkedIn

Please get in touch and let me know how I can help you. If it's a CV you want to be reviewed, a connection, or just someone to speak to, I'm happy to help.
