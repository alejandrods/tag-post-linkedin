"Why is the ping of another email transforming some of us into the Incredible Hulk? If you are feeling like Bruce Banner or seeing such transformations in your workplace- tune in at Wednesday lunchtime.
Looking forward to chatting with Yamini Naidu CSP and Mark Henderson about the impact of our communications both during isolation and as we emerge out of this."
"As we wish to prefer Local over Global for internal needs and going from local to global branding, we need to compete globally. Are we in that position or have that mindset ?   Quality is utmost important. Are we really quality conscious or aware ? We have product catalog with excellent specifications but do we really check those at time of acquiring those products ?   
For an example, in ceramics industry, fuel is 50% of the variable cost and slight compromise in MOR by heating less during inflationary market could save hugely on fuel cost. Similarly, thickness reduction or using alternate material could save on material cost though it would deteriorate the strength of final product.   
Are we really ready to change our mindset ?

"If someone has not seen The Last Dance, a Michael Jordan biopic by Netflix, I cannot recommend it enough. Asked whether his desire to win cost him a nice-guy reputation, he served one of the best quotes on 
hashtag
#leadership.

""Winning has a price. And leadership has a price. So I pulled people along when they didn't want to be pulled; I challenged people when they didn't want to be challenged. I earned that right because my teammates who came after me didn't endure all the things that I endured.

""Once you joined the team, you lived at a certain standard that I played the game at, and I wasn't gonna take anything less. Now if that meant I had to go in there and get in your ass a little bit, then I did that. You ask all my teammates: 'The one thing about Michael Jordan was he never asked me to do something that he didn't do.'

""When people see this, they're gonna say, 'Well, he wasn't really a nice guy, he may have been a tyrant.' Well, that's you: Because you never won anything. I wanted to win, but I wanted them to win and be a part of that as well. Look: I don't have to do this. I'm only doing it because it is who I am. That's how I played the game; that was my mentality. If you don't wanna play that way, don't play that way.""

"How can you use conflict and disagreement to add value to your relationships and improve your career?

Lousin defines 
hashtag
#conflict as an expressed 
hashtag
#disagreement. 

You think one thing. 

I think another thing. 

Both of us assertively and respectfully articulate our views. 

Then we have a discussion where we reconcile our differences. 

When it comes down to it, conflict is an opportunity. 

An opportunity to…

- Learn.

- Strengthen the relationship.

- Improve your circumstances and get better deals.

- And much more!

Remember, the best things in life are on the other side of difficult conversations. 

Lousin did a great job of explaining why it’s important to assertively engage in these conversations and how to maximize these opportunities in your personal and professional lives.

She also lets us know the dangers of relying on logic as your primary persuasive tool.

"What if your prospects and clients have no pain points and no problems?

The vast majority of companies I know don’t have problems at all, and have achieved success. However, that is not to say that there is nothing that can’t be improved. The leader of every business I know without exception always has some aspect of the business he or she wants to change or improve, and is frequently looking for any help or advantage to do so more rapidly and with a greater likelihood of success.

This is exactly what happen to me this past year.
"In the not so distant past, I did this Gallup strength survey. I was pleasantly surprised with the results in that it both confirmed certain traits but also surprised me. My wife has confirmed these insights and I'm asking all those who know me to read and give your opinion as well. COVID-19 has allowed me to do some introspection and slow down and this was something I was drawn back to for reflection and direction.

"“Proaction is worth viewing as a superpower because it is the “possible you” that 1) spots and prevents problems, 2) identifies, pursues, and captures opportunities, and 3) creates a new, personally-chosen, desired future through a strategic change of trajectory.

Proaction is what drives constructive change. It is essential to successful self-management, leadership and entrepreneurship, and even to tackling and solving society’s global challenges.

Proactive behaviors are therefore self-chosen, directed at personally-appealing long-term goals, and pursued thoughtfully. When you add to this mix authentic collaboration with others, you are 1) engaging in real leadership, and 2) employing a power that can deliver those needs — over time, for the long haul — for yourself and others.”

"REFLECTIONS AS A DIRECTOR: When your title is MORE THAN a title, it becomes LEADERSHIP. Leadership is influence. Influence becomes impact. Impact is born when the leader has his followers best interest in his heart. He is not just a leader. He is a mentor, example, coach, counselor, teacher, and trainer. Sometimes he becomes a big brother, confident, and role model. He ultimately realizes it's not about him. He is not a dictator, who forces his name to be great or his legacy to be prematurely built. HE IS A SERVANT who master's his responsibilities AND operates as the above mentioned. His motives are true and genuine.

"We’ve come to equate saying “I see it differently” or “I don’t agree” with being angry, rude, or unkind, so it makes most people horribly uncomfortable.

If long term success is the goal, a team must learn to navigate that uncomfortable feeling and overcome it to drive positive outcomes. Establish a ground rule that people’s opinions matter to create an inclusive work environment. Lack of opinions or agreeing to everything blindly serves no one. I’ve seen the best founders actually thrive in healthy debates and then make informed decisions rather than suppress others’ opinions as unworthy.

During my 24 yrs at Cognizant (joined as an Entry Level Trainee in 1996), Cognizant literally has taught me to crawl, walk, jog, run and even complete many Marathons successfully. Through these years, I have worked closely with several leaders who shaped the Organization and been my mentors and helped in shaping my career at Cognizant, the entrepreneurial spirit to always bring the best for our Clients & Cognizant, our Unique differentiator. 

I am also grateful for the wonderful experience working with Team Life Sciences (where I have spent almost 18+ yrs), in playing several roles - right from leading delivery for a portfolio to being the Global Delivery Head for the BU, being part of several key client journeys and building a very strong team, with our unique products & platforms and Domain / Client leadership.  I had the opportunity to build a strong team of Leaders.

While it is time to say goodbye, the memories of all these 24 years at Cognizant (and Life Sciences) will stay with me forever.

"Have been watching The Last Dance on Netflix and found this take on leadership by Michael Jordan fascinating as to the insight of what it takes to be the best. 

He pushed people hard to be the best they could knowing it wouldn't make him the most popular but he just wanted to bring but the crucial line was that he wouldn't ask them to do something that he couldn't.

Clearly not every player could be at his level but he wanted the team to share his success. Leadership will inevitably lead to you making unpopular decisions but if you're on the end of those decisions remember sometimes you have to do things you don't like to make you and your team better.

"'The Law of Addition'


¡Hola Mi Gente! Hello My LinkedIn Family!


This is my 9th Video from the 
hashtag
#30DaysofVideos Challenge. Today I wanted to talk about the 4th law from the 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership by John C. Maxwell. 

""The Law of Addition for leadership states that if you choose to serve your customers and your employees by adding value rather than trying to come out on top or make yourself richer, higher profits will follow.""

I would like to challenge everyone to live by this rule so that we may be great leaders and successful professionals.

"Is fear a good motivator?

Up until now we'd consider this question in terms of boss's attitude towards their employees or line manager's attitude towards their team.

Recently we've been afraid of many things.

👉That we could become ill
👉That our loved ones could become ill
👉That the employment market will suffer 
👉That we won't be able to support our lifestyles anymore
👉That the holidays we've booked will be cancelled etc.

Everyone has worries and we all deal with them differently.

👉Some people learn new skills to become more resilient
👉Some people focus on keeping their business afloat
👉Some people focus on their hobbies
👉Some people take this time to rest
👉Some people feel paralysed by anxiety

We are not all in the same boat, but we are in the same storm.

Are you motivated?

What are you doing to power through it?

What are you doing to help your employees, colleagues and friends power through it?

Let's share some ideas!

"Over this quarantine I have had plenty of time to reflect on my first year of being a full-time worker post degree completion.
When I first took on this position as a professional staff member for a higher education institution many of my friends told me they were disappointed. They said I was “too smart to hold a position like this” or that I had worked “too hard in undergrad to just work with college students.” I can look back and say that I never felt that way. 
As frustrating as certain things were throughout this year I remained thankful for one thing - the ability to work with students and be a mentor to them. I know how complicated college is and it was a blessing in disguise to have the freshman class as my focus student population. It was very refreshing and they constantly kept me on my toes.
I was also happy to keep the promise I made to myself two years ago to step into this role to give back to paraprofessional staff by being their advisor.
Overall I have had a great experience. I do not think there is such thing as “too smart” for Higher Ed. and if you think so you have most likely never been a part of it. I am now looking forward to starting the next chapter in my life as a graduate student & employee at a bigger institution!

"How Will You Help Create a Better World?

It is all well and good to wish for a better world, but what can you do to make this happen?

What WILL you do is more to the point.

Don't imaging that we can go back to normal.

Arianna Huffington is crystal clear on this topic:

""We're Never Going Back""

The pandemic has forced many of us to recognise that our society has fundamental weaknesses.

It has been all too easy to ""look the other way"" and pretend that problems did not exist.

We are at a crucible, which involves rapid and transformative changes.

New Zealand is blessed by being small and remote.

The tyranny of distance has suddenly been replaced by being an island haven that could be the home of a new society. 

Small countries with great leaders, like Jacinda Ardern, have the will and the means to make radical changes happen and happen quickly. 

The expression ""Fortune Favours The Brave"" comes from Roman times.

The meaning is courageous action is often rewarded.

New Zealand's Prime Minister is rightly proud to lead a team of five million.

The vast majority are rightly proud that we have an inspiring leader in such challenging times.

We all have a role to play, no matter how small.

So, what will you do to help create a better world?

"Success, growth and greatness is never easy. It can be slow to show any progress. It can be frustrating and unrewarding at times.

Stay focused, keep your faith and continue to believe in what you are doing even when we don’t see immediate results. Be patient and persistent.

Don’t compare your journey to those around you because all that glitters is not gold. Deep roots yield the sweetest fruits.

Position is about mindset and focusing on the things you can control over the things you cannot. 

Here are some of the reflections shared recently by participants on the topic…

"☺️Morning, I got many UX resources from many books and years of experience, who wants to learn together? https://lnkd.in/gC-6u_R

One of the most recurring questions I get from people in the UX field is if I have any tips for getting started in UX design or how to apply UX in their work.

1. What UX books do you recommend?
2. What should I do to get started / advance in UX Design?
3. How can I get in the right path of creating better user experiences with my company?
and many more...

So, instead of answering your question 1-by-1, I decided to gather my learning materials help you grow in your UX career!

I will share more when I have time 👍

Travelling around, while cycling, I was inspired by what I saw. small groups of people enjoying the sunshine together.

"Absolutely thrilled with the outcome of my work with the UK Cabinet. We’ve successfully gained funding to provide UK children living in poverty with the technology they need for online learning during quarantining & beyond. This will help to support a more equitable chance for learning for these children now and into the future. It was an international  team effort & I am thrilled to have been be part of it.

"Do you RESPOND or do you REACT? 

Hopefully most of the time, especially in high-stress situations, you are known as someone who responds rather than reacts. 

Reacting can damage our relationships, challenge our reputation, hurt our credibility and minimise trust. It is always better to respond. 

In your next conversation / meeting / business deal / argument / challenging situation, take just Four Seconds before you speak. 
While 4 seconds is all it takes to lose focus, that’s all it takes to regain focus too. 

>> Four seconds - one breath - is all it takes to stop yourself from a counter-productive knee-jerk reaction. 

>> Four seconds is all it takes to make a more intentional, strategic choice that’s more likely to get you where you want to go. 

For a more in-depth insight into this approach, check out Peter Bregman's book, 'Four Seconds.'

"My understanding, calibrate accordingly. 

COVID-19 is uniquely dangerous for a COMBINATION of reasons making it DIFFERENT from the flu: 

1.No vaccine. 
2. High Transmissibility. 
3. Mortality rate. 

It's the COMBINATION. 

A lack of reliable testing prevents dynamic isolation.

This is about the Com.bin.a.tion of factors, not one (mortality rate, which varies by climate, community health, ...)

Saying the mortality rate for those infected is less than that of, say Ebola (50%), means nothing because transmissibility is different. Also, there are now drug cocktails at an appropriate availability given the transmission rate to respond and there is reliable testing that informs isolation of folks confirmed to have it. 

Yes, lack of testing keeps your reporting numbers low (a false sense of security?). But, a lack of reliable testing also prevents isolation mitigations that prevent spread of the disease, which again is highly transmissible. Testing is about informing dynamic isolation and monitoring prevalence within the herd - not our individual infection status at random points in time.

Again... Not an epidemiologist or an MD ... So crush this logic as needed. 

Fire at will. Leaders need to think through this to keep their people, and their families, safe.

Has your business been affected negatively? 

Here are some options to consider.......
If the answer is NO, then can you do more, increase capacity, second shift, acquire new machinery? If not, then continue and maximize business from existing facilities. 

If the answer is YES, are you able to offer your products/services through a different channel or to a different market?  If NO, are you able to make or offer a different a product, eg sanitizer, not Gin and just do it? If No, then focus on cost reduction & loss mitigation. 

However, if you can offer your products or services through a different channel, eg home delivery, online, then crack on and do it.

"My realization in lock down – The 3rd thing: I have always been hearing the benefits of having that 3rd thing - a hobby, passion, engagement outside of 1) work and 2) family/social life. In 22 years of my career, I was unable to realize its real value. However, COVID lock down offered me 4 hours of extra time per day, more mental peace & less physical stress. It also gave me an opportunity, rather forced me to be with my own self, without much of a baggage or distractions. Voila, I could connect & realized that there can be that 3rd thing. Initial results are great, I did create something, but the best part is I feel great, de-stressed, happy, satisfied. It seems to have made the rest of my (work)day even better & I have become a better person. Bottom line, it’s worthwhile exploring yourself & finding that 3rd thing - nurture it, give time to it & don’t give up. It can be anything running, painting, arts, writing, music, social work..anything. 
Do you feel the same, any thoughts, realizations? Share your story, your 3rd thing. BTW my 3rd thing is that I've started writing poems & short stories. I have tried to narrate my poem too. Here it is, It’s a poem in Hindi

 I happened to read this letter from Brain Chesky to his employees. He had to let go 25% of the workforce. This gentleman teaches us some extraordinary lessons in business and 
hashtag
#leadership  and his decisions are real eye opener for the rest of the

1) Since laptops are important for your next job search, the

#employees can retain their Apple laptops.
2) The health insurance scheme stays active for the remaining part of the year and also their mental health is taken care off.
3) The ESOP plans - Everyone leaving is still eligible for the 25th May vesting date.
4) Job support, through the Alumina Talent Directory and placement team.
5) One to One interaction with the senior leadership and complete transparency which surely breeds confidence.
This is in addition to the severance package for at least 14 weeks plus tenure increase consistent with the country specific practice."
"In one of our communication campaigns in the year 2017, we urged family owned and run business to consciously choose to shift from ownership mindset and leadership mindset. 

Since then, a lot has changed for businesses in our country. New regulations, legislations, rules, volatile economy and uncertain business environment. Yet, the solution of all these lie in the way we conduct businesses, and not in the product or business itself. 

With this pandemic, it is not more important than ever before to shift - From owner to leadership mindset. 

We don’t claim that we are all there or that it is an easy process but we do assure that process Enroute is better than the ones who never even started the journey. A lot of clarity comes once you choose to grow.

"It's dark, you're driving a car 🚗 without a GPS or map; not sure if the road leads to the destination. You are surrounded by uncertainty. 

👇🏼 👇🏼 👇🏼 👇🏼 👇🏼 👇🏼

The terrain is unknown, the roads are unpredictable and there are twists and turns every hour.  

This is what leadership looks and feels in COVID 19 times. 

This is the topic for today's LinkedIn Live > Leadership in uncertain times (COVID 19 times) 

It's tough out there for leaders. There are said and unsaid expectations on you. 

For this conversation, leaders = parents, community leaders, business leaders and YOU. 

Join Karalyn Brown and I for another stimulating conversation with Robin Sawan who helps organisations build 'Leadership from the Emerging Future.

"It may feel like you can’t make plans for anything at the moment - both personally and professionally.
The feeling of uncertainty can make you feel so out of control. I get it, I feel like that too at times.
However, when I remind myself (and my clients) there are things that we can predict, and work with options, you can feel calmer.

For example, a client today is due to return to work at the same time that the schools and nurseries are due to reopen.

But she isn’t sure what will happen or how it will look.

The thing that she can predict is inconsistent childcare. 
So how will she work around this ?

Conversations with her manager 
Understanding about workload 
Discussions with her other half around roles 
Preparing for a flexible working week 

I know it’s not perfect - but she now feels a little calmer!

Bear this in mind when you are communicating with the returners in your team.

"I am happy to announce what we started as a movement in 2018 has now turned into an organization for Young Leaders.
It is important that we invest more and more in our youth for a vibrant democracy, it took me 8 years to fight many forces and I am still trying to survive and find my space in policy and politics.
Politics and Policy have a lot of entry barriers for youth and especially for women and those with no political, and financial backgrounds.
The idea of Yuva Galam converting into an organization is to incubate these young leaders and equip them with resources and network which I and many struggled for in our initial days."
"Trying something new is always a risk because there is no guarantee of success...

My workshop this Saturday can help you handle that risk.

He was too senior to have lead the charge to flush out the terrorists. But as a true leader, this highly decorated soldier believed in being together with his team. He gave up his life in the process. This is leadership. I salute the 5 and their colleagues who keep the country safe.

Weaving your leading.
"Leaders, do you believe every person on your team is capable and resourceful?

Many leaders will say YES... but often when they dig a little deeper, they realise that often our bias and assumptions are causing us from seeing everyone as fully capable. 

But this is one of the biggest pitfalls as leaders....

Unless you believe that people possess more capabilities than they are currently expressing you will not be able to help them express it. 

For an organisation to achieve a truly collaborative culture in which people are self-motivated, there needs to be a belief that every individual is fully capable and resourceful. 

Instead of delegating the most complex of tasks to the select few on your team, it's time to provide opportunities to those on your team who haven't had their chance to shine. 

Yes, to coach successfully you have to adopt a far more optimistic view than usual of the dormant capability of all people- a coaching mindset. 

Start believing in everyone's potential and support and coach them to bring their best ideas and their potential to life.

"A Resiliency Tip a Day 
Resiliency is the ability to bounce back in the face of adversity. This week we are celebrating Chester County Resilience Week by focusing on one resiliency factor a day.

Day 2: Mindful Monday (5/4/20)
""Mindful: focusing on the present moment while accepting one's thoughts, feelings and body sensation""

Today, I took time to be still and notice what I was feeling.   Not an easy thing for this driven personality to do for sure.  Sometimes my feelings are not so positive so then I need to not judge them...just notice them!

How are your practicing mindfulness today? What helps you to be present?

"WHAT GOES BEHIND A VIRTUAL TALK?

Last Friday I had a talk to give to the Rotary Club of Madras Central. Now, obviously the lockdown came as a total surprise and like many others, I wasn't ready for virtual talks setup. 

But, where necessity is the mother of invention and setback is the father of creativity how I could I have not delivered the talk? 

Sharing a small clip from the talk, with a bonus of a tiny sneak peek of the backstage! (Note: Though I wasn't very comfortable sharing the backstage setup, I feel it's my responsibility to share the ""nowhere close to perfect makeshift setup"" with everyone who is still struggling to get comfortable with virtual.)

#Leadership] E06: Learning

My hardest video to do!

This is probably my favourite topic with respect to leadership, and this video could have been MUCH longer, but I did my best keep it short and digestible.

Learning focused 3 ways:
• Self-Learning
• Learning to see
• Learning another's world

As always, please share, like or comment to help push this video outside of my network so that it might find its way to more first time managers.

"Varsha Waishampayan discusses how to approach mentorship. Mentorship is a responsibility! 
- Mentorship is paying-it-forward with your experiential guidance 
- Giving advice alone is not mentoring  - Though it is part of the job, the goal of mentoring is to help the mentee grow and not just solve a problem
- Analyze the effect of your mentorship - Is it working? Can your mentee articulate the significant impact you have had on them?
- Are you learning as a mentor? Learning is a two-way street
- Make mentoring part of your organizational culture. If you want your organization to value mentorship, you need to set an example.

If you sow corn, you reap corn. If you sow beans, you will harvest beans. If you sow discord, negativity and distrust, you will reap the same.

"How can we build our Resilience & Growth Mindset Super Power Muscle??
Resilience is the ability to bounce back from unexpected Change, Challenging Times, Adversity, or even Loss. But it is also the ability to thrive & succeed in our modern, fast pace, superficial, artificial, money driven & often times fake+ego driven society.  In leadership, it's the secret sauce for success. A strong mind & unbreakable spirit spiced with a massive portion of Grit will always conquer the world by storm! To be a resilient leader it takes courage, adaptability & the strength to persevere when things don't go your way, when things get really hard & uncomfortable. 
Practice self-care, self-leadership, self-compassion, self-love, & self-respect. During difficult times, it's important that we take care of ourselves inside and outside of work. Resilience is about recovery, bouncing forward not so much endurance. Get appropriate rest, time alone, downtime & support from family, friends & mates, and take time to recharge via working out, meditation or even breathing exercises.  Do whatever it is that makes you feel more grounded again, whatever makes you feel strong, ready & ""gritty""!
