"How to make your resume stand out?

1. The key to making your resume attractive to a company is to tailor it to the job description.

2. Play with keywords - If you have the skills the employer is looking for do not refrain from mentioning it in bold on your resume.

3. Remove common skills – Add specific skills that your manager, recruiter is looking for.

4. Make sure your resume is simple and easy to read - This is because employers have a minimal amount of time.

5. Proofread and edit - Undergo several rounds of reading for spell checks or grammatical errors.

Enticing and ensuring our job
"The first CV I ever sent out was in a Word file. I had minimal experience, but it was still on two pages. It had a lot of white space and incorrect formatting.

My current CV is a PDF one-pager filled with specific examples of my achievements and formatted so that it is easy to read while containing all the information needed.

When I was just starting out, I never thought it would look like it looks now. Let’s see what it looks like in 9 more years.

For everybody else who is redoing their CVs right now, hope this helps!

"Good expose' on the difference between ""Lean"" and ""Agile"" and the misconception that Lean simply means ""cutting"" waste. A company should be well-versed in both methodologies, understand how they are complimentary not competing techniques, and be open-minded about how both tools (or religions as some see it) can be employed to improve business processes and beat the competition. Maybe we start by calling it ""AgiliLean""...thoughts?

"“People don’t leave their jobs, they leave toxic cultures”

People don’t leave their jobs, they leave their bosses”

These ideas are true but have been pushed around as if employers are always the guilty party whenever people leave their organizations. 

The employment relationship is like any other relationship. Either party could be the guilty party.

There are people who actually leave their jobs but not their bosses or toxic cultures. Some people just don’t want to commit to a long term relationship. Some don’t find enough challenge/inspiration in their jobs and move on, some realize they are meant for something else and move on.

There are also toxic people who don’t fit into good cultures or don’t get ahead in meritocratic environments. When such people leave, it is good news for the employer because they have been saved from having such people polluting others.

"Well, Yes, Today is my last day of working at NIAR. It's been 1.5 yr since I started working as a Research Intern and Assisted in various aircraft manufacturing company projects based on composite testing. I sincerely Thank my Manager, supervisors and finally Team Members for making me learn the things real quickly. They made me understand the value of Time and Team management. I have practically experienced about the process involved in composites testing and strain gauging according to ASTM standards. I personally thank my friend Rohith for his reference. I strongly feel that the tools and terminology skills gained from this organization will definitely help me in my career while searching for jobs.

"Maya Angelou said “If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.” Attitude matters period! It affects everything... from relationships, to the way you perform at work, and how you choose to interact with those around you. The most important step you can take toward achieving your greatest potential in life is learning to monitor your attitude. 

In the workplace there will always be something, or even someone, we do not like or care for. We won’t always be able to change our environment to correct the matter. This is not an excuse to be unprofessional. Instead, adjust the way YOU think. A positive attitude is what will truly help one to cope. Here are three strategies you may find useful!

(1) Affirmations repeated several times each day. They can have a positive impact on mindset and negate falling into negative thought patterns.

(2) Holding grudges against something or someone in your “mind” is harmful and can produce a bad attitude. Be forgiving and just move on! 

(3) Always act with a purpose. Your actions should always be in line with your core values. Often times if I recall to mind my values I can prevent myself from acting out in a way that conflicts with them.

"WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING?

Most of us have been on lockdown for almost 8 weeks.  In 8 weeks what NEW SKILL have you learned?  

Here's what I've been learning:

- Trading
- Value Investing

""The only skill that will be important in the 21st Century will be the skill of learning new skills"" Peter Drucker

If you are reading this and haven't invested in yourself, in up-skilling or re-skilling, you are missing a trick.

The train will not wait for late passengers.  So get yourself future-ready, or you will be in for a major shock my friend. 

You're welcome.

"As a graduate, gaining the experience aspect for any field can be extremely hard. 

Employers should be looking for characters with perseverance, passion and motivation within prospective employees. Most instances, people get rejected at the application level but you really get to know an individual in the interview stages... get to know the people."

"I secured lots of internships in second year of uni.

Here’s how.

In my first year, I achieved highly.

I was awarded a scholarship based off the inspirational Stephen Lawrence’s legacy.

I was selected to sit on my student union’s trustee board.

I achieved a 2:1 in my studies.

Then I panicked.

I felt like becoming a lawyer was still out of reach.

This gave me imposter syndrome.

I tried to get lots of internships to compensate for this.

I applied for internships through my law school.

I held up a sign up asking for experience.

I asked everyone they knew and their cousin for internships.

However, after getting multiple law internships, I still got rejected at job interviews.

I learnt something very important:

“I don’t need more work experience to prove that I am good enough. I am good enough.”

This turned a page for me.

I stopped attributing my success in law to how much work experience I got.

I started attributing my success in law to who I was as a person.

I learnt that all the legal work experience in the world wouldn’t get me a job.

Only I could.

Believe in your experiences.

Develop yourself personally and professionally.

Proactively seek new opportunities.

That will get you through the door, not just more experience.

Great advice for recent grads searching for jobs right now!
"How to make your resume stand out?

1. The key to making your resume attractive to a company is to tailor it to the job description.

2. Play with keywords - If you have the skills the employer is looking for do not refrain from mentioning it in bold on your resume.

3. Remove common skills – Add specific skills that your manager, recruiter is looking for.

4. Make sure your resume is simple and easy to read - This is because employers have a minimal amount of time.

5. Proofread and edit - Undergo several rounds of reading for spell checks or grammatical errors.

You think you have the best resume?

This is the need of the hour! Especially when an employee resigns looking for a better opportunity !!!
"How to make your resume stand out?

2. Play with keywords - If you have the skills the employer is looking for do not refrain from mentioning it in bold on your resume.

4. Make your resume is simple and easy to read - This is because employers have a minimal amount of time.

From my perspective - now more than ever counts effectiveness and performance of each person in the company, especially those who are in direct contact with the customer. Each unattended or poorly served client is a loss for the company. Multiplied by the number of days of the company’s operations in the year it seems to be a drama not only for a financial director. 

Let me give this example: In a hotel, more important than the marketing director responsible for attractive advertising is receptionist. This receptionist gives credence to the promise made in advertisement. FULL STOP.

Regardless of the fact that we've not yet been able to work in the same room, she has been an excellent addition for us and has slotted in perfectly to our ASR family.

Also, to anyone who is cautious of on-boarding employees remotely during this time, it can absolutely be done and be done well. Feel free to reach out if we can provide any advice on this. We'd be happy to help.

"Dear network,
As a result of the Covid-19, I will be available for new opportunities outside Sofigate after 1st August 2020. 

Reflecting on my time at Sofigate🤔, I have had tons of fun working with great colleagues & clients and gained lots of learning, while getting the opportunity to deliver client transformations through process optimisation, operational excellence, change management and digitalisation for example ServiceNow implementations.

I am now actively looking to find my next big thing, which would be in the area of transformation, product/process management or executive advisory (see below as inspiration).😃

Any kind of help in spreading the words is much appreciated (clicking ‘like’, sharing this post and/or ‘old-school’ talking to people you know in your network). 🗣️
 
You are also most welcome to reach out for a ‘virtual coffee talk’ or a catch-up (outdoor in the sun with enough social distancing). 😉
 
My contact info is: andimadsen@hotmail.com or phone: +45 2648 2445
Big thanks in advance and I wish you all the best.

"Are there any good RECRUITERS out there?

Recruiters generally suffer from a negative or bad reputation and they are even seen by many employers as a 'necessary evil' when it comes to finding staff.

There are many employers who will NEVER use recruiters - ""we're not paying those ridiculous fees.""...""they just keep sending us CV's which don't even match up.""...""I don't even think the candidates were interviewed before they come to us.""👎

Candidates from all walks of life, white or blue collar, have at least one horror story to tell about their experience at the hands of a recruiter.

""I have not heard back from him for weeks.""...""she won't even return my calls.""...""all I got was an email reply telling me I wasn't suitable.""😠

Recruiters are everywhere - So how will you know which one best suits you?

Here are just a few key tips...

✔ Partner with a recruiter - it's your CAREER & not just a job
✔ Qualify them - HOW much & WHO do they really know?
✔Seek recommendations from family, friends, colleagues & your network
✔ Set some guidelines for YOU and the RECRUITER!

I know everyone's circumstances differ but you need to have CONTROL.👌

And we all know what comes from a RELATIONSHIP - TRUST!👍💙

"At career conversations (https://bit.ly/caconv), I realise professionals who are stuck haven’t been able to switch from traditional channels (e.g. walkins, job portals) to create new career opportunities. 

The way I see it, every channel has its limitations both in terms of depth and breadth of options that the channel can provide. 

Beyond a point in one’s career journey, one will be required to evolve their way into a different channel based on one’s goals. May have to create one too.

Happy channeling! :)

"Do you want to know the one secret that can make your team stick with you and in fact follow you wherever you go!
 
Each individual needs to grow since constant progression and growth are critical to keeping us motivated and happy. When we as leaders stretch our team members, give them challenging assignments that push them out of their comfort zones, that’s where they relish their mind opening up and learning new things!
 
Remember, growth always happens out of the comfort zone! Yes, there will be some initial internal resistance, however, as a leader you are expected to show the confidence and push them to do it!
 
Most of the leaders I have seen feel guilty about stretching the team, however, in my experience, your top performers will love the experience of being challenged outside of their limits and they will do whatever it takes to do it.
 
Don’t you enjoy the experience when your leader trusts you with some critical, high visibility, challenging task and the joy on their face when you go back and deliver it!
 
Try it for yourself and let me know what happens!

"How will Covid19 end? Will it be a medical breakthrough or a socioeconomic path of frustration and exhaustion of the disease affecting normalcy?  With protests and economic worries, we will push a ""back to normal"" feel into society, but at what cost? Will Media die down the importance of precautions causing the virus to silently increase confirmed cases and deaths, until it fades away? Historically, pandemics have been infiltrating our populations for centuries, with only smallpox to consider as a pandemic with an actual medical end.

"This is great advice. Networking is very important, and I agree with all he has shared. 

From my recent experiences and what I have learned, I would add: Know what you want for your career, purpose of networking with that person, and how they may be able to help you. Combine that with being genuine as he mentioned and the person you are networking with will likely remember you and follow up with what you have asked.

And as mentioned... it's a process. Hang in there!

"🌏Would you rather be famous or unforgettable? 😎🧐

Many strive to be famous 📸 or go “viral”. 

However isn’t it more impactful to be unforgettably impactful rather than famous? 🤔
These days so many people can be famous due to doing something different 💥

I’ll put it into perspective. 

Many don’t know their great grandmother’s or grandfather’s name🧐
Not because they weren’t great individuals, but because their impact was not talked about generations deep📈

Be unforgettable in the lives around you because of the difference you made in their life✅
