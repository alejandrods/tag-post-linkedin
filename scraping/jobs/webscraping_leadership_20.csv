"If someone has not seen The Last Dance, a Michael Jordan biopic by Netflix, I cannot recommend it enough. Asked whether his desire to win cost him a nice-guy reputation, he served one of the best quotes on

#leadership.

""Winning has a price. And leadership has a price. So I pulled people along when they didn't want to be pulled; I challenged people when they didn't want to be challenged. I earned that right because my teammates who came after me didn't endure all the things that I endured.

""Once you joined the team, you lived at a certain standard that I played the game at, and I wasn't gonna take anything less. Now if that meant I had to go in there and get in your ass a little bit, then I did that. You ask all my teammates: 'The one thing about Michael Jordan was he never asked me to do something that he didn't do.'

""When people see this, they're gonna say, 'Well, he wasn't really a nice guy, he may have been a tyrant.' Well, that's you: Because you never won anything. I wanted to win, but I wanted them to win and be a part of that as well. Look: I don't have to do this. I'm only doing it because it is who I am. That's how I played the game; that was my mentality. If you don't wanna play that way, don't play that way.""

"How can you use conflict and disagreement to add value to your relationships and improve your career?

Lousin defines 
hashtag
#conflict as an expressed 
hashtag
#disagreement. 

You think one thing. 

I think another thing. 

Both of us assertively and respectfully articulate our views. 

Then we have a discussion where we reconcile our differences. 

When it comes down to it, conflict is an opportunity. 

An opportunity to…

- Learn.

- Strengthen the relationship.

- Improve your circumstances and get better deals.

- And much more!

Remember, the best things in life are on the other side of difficult conversations. 

Lousin did a great job of explaining why it’s important to assertively engage in these conversations and how to maximize these opportunities in your personal and professional lives.

She also lets us know the dangers of relying on logic as your primary persuasive tool.

"“Proaction is worth viewing as a superpower because it is the “possible you” that 1) spots and prevents problems, 2) identifies, pursues, and captures opportunities, and 3) creates a new, personally-chosen, desired future through a strategic change of trajectory.

Proaction is what drives constructive change. It is essential to successful self-management, leadership and entrepreneurship, and even to tackling and solving society’s global challenges.

Proactive behaviors are therefore self-chosen, directed at personally-appealing long-term goals, and pursued thoughtfully. When you add to this mix authentic collaboration with others, you are 1) engaging in real leadership, and 2) employing a power that can deliver those needs — over time, for the long haul — for yourself and others.”

"REFLECTIONS AS A DIRECTOR: When your title is MORE THAN a title, it becomes LEADERSHIP. Leadership is influence. Influence becomes impact. Impact is born when the leader has his followers best interest in his heart. He is not just a leader. He is a mentor, example, coach, counselor, teacher, and trainer. Sometimes he becomes a big brother, confident, and role model. He ultimately realizes it's not about him. He is not a dictator, who forces his name to be great or his legacy to be prematurely built. HE IS A SERVANT who master's his responsibilities AND operates as the above mentioned. His motives are true and genuine.

"We’ve come to equate saying “I see it differently” or “I don’t agree” with being angry, rude, or unkind, so it makes most people horribly uncomfortable.

If long term success is the goal, a team must learn to navigate that uncomfortable feeling and overcome it to drive positive outcomes. Establish a ground rule that people’s opinions matter to create an inclusive work environment. Lack of opinions or agreeing to everything blindly serves no one. I’ve seen the best founders actually thrive in healthy debates and then make informed decisions rather than suppress others’ opinions as unworthy.

"This note is to say ‘Thank you’ to all my Colleagues (and ex-colleagues) as well as my Clients who have been part of my wonderful journey at Cognizant, that came to an end on 30th April 2020.

During my 24 yrs at Cognizant (joined as an Entry Level Trainee in 1996), Cognizant literally has taught me to crawl, walk, jog, run and even complete many Marathons successfully. Through these years, I have worked closely with several leaders who shaped the Organization and been my mentors and helped in shaping my career at Cognizant, the entrepreneurial spirit to always bring the best for our Clients & Cognizant, our Unique differentiator. 

I am also grateful for the wonderful experience working with Team Life Sciences (where I have spent almost 18+ yrs), in playing several roles - right from leading delivery for a portfolio to being the Global Delivery Head for the BU, being part of several key client journeys and building a very strong team, with our unique products & platforms and Domain / Client leadership.  I had the opportunity to build a strong team of Leaders.

While it is time to say goodbye, the memories of all these 24 years at Cognizant (and Life Sciences) will stay with me forever.

Thank you COGNIZANT

"Have been watching The Last Dance on Netflix and found this take on leadership by Michael Jordan fascinating as to the insight of what it takes to be the best. 

He pushed people hard to be the best they could knowing it wouldn't make him the most popular but he just wanted to bring but the crucial line was that he wouldn't ask them to do something that he couldn't.

Clearly not every player could be at his level but he wanted the team to share his success. Leadership will inevitably lead to you making unpopular decisions but if you're on the end of those decisions remember sometimes you have to do things you don't like to make you and your team better.

"Over this quarantine I have had plenty of time to reflect on my first year of being a full-time worker post degree completion.
When I first took on this position as a professional staff member for a higher education institution many of my friends told me they were disappointed. They said I was “too smart to hold a position like this” or that I had worked “too hard in undergrad to just work with college students.” I can look back and say that I never felt that way. 
As frustrating as certain things were throughout this year I remained thankful for one thing - the ability to work with students and be a mentor to them. I know how complicated college is and it was a blessing in disguise to have the freshman class as my focus student population. It was very refreshing and they constantly kept me on my toes.
I was also happy to keep the promise I made to myself two years ago to step into this role to give back to paraprofessional staff by being their advisor.
Overall I have had a great experience. I do not think there is such thing as “too smart” for Higher Ed. and if you think so you have most likely never been a part of it. I am now looking forward to starting the next chapter in my life as a graduate student & employee at a bigger institution!

One of the most recurring questions I get from people in the UX field is if I have any tips for getting started in UX design or how to apply UX in their work.

1. What UX books do you recommend?
2. What should I do to get started / advance in UX Design?
3. How can I get in the right path of creating better user experiences with my company?
and many more...

"My understanding, calibrate accordingly. 

COVID-19 is uniquely dangerous for a COMBINATION of reasons making it DIFFERENT from the flu: 

1.No vaccine. 
2. High Transmissibility. 
3. Mortality rate. 

It's the COMBINATION. 

A lack of reliable testing prevents dynamic isolation.

This is about the Com.bin.a.tion of factors, not one (mortality rate, which varies by climate, community health, ...)

Saying the mortality rate for those infected is less than that of, say Ebola (50%), means nothing because transmissibility is different. Also, there are now drug cocktails at an appropriate availability given the transmission rate to respond and there is reliable testing that informs isolation of folks confirmed to have it. 

Yes, lack of testing keeps your reporting numbers low (a false sense of security?). But, a lack of reliable testing also prevents isolation mitigations that prevent spread of the disease, which again is highly transmissible. Testing is about informing dynamic isolation and monitoring prevalence within the herd - not our individual infection status at random points in time.

Again... Not an epidemiologist or an MD ... So crush this logic as needed. 

Fire at will. Leaders need to think through this to keep their people, and their families, safe.

"It may feel like you can’t make plans for anything at the moment - both personally and professionally.
The feeling of uncertainty can make you feel so out of control. I get it, I feel like that too at times.
However, when I remind myself (and my clients) there are things that we can predict, and work with options, you can feel calmer.

For example, a client today is due to return to work at the same time that the schools and nurseries are due to reopen.

But she isn’t sure what will happen or how it will look.

The thing that she can predict is inconsistent childcare. 
So how will she work around this ?

Conversations with her manager 
Understanding about workload 
Discussions with her other half around roles 
Preparing for a flexible working week 

I know it’s not perfect - but she now feels a little calmer!

Bear this in mind when you are communicating with the returners in your team.

"I like this because it is very clear. I wonder how many employees of how many companies don't really give a damn about wordy and soundbitey 'mission statements' because they know they are basically bullshit. Creating a business culture where everyone can thrive takes a bit more  ba...,  well let's be polite and say intelligent ownership.

"Reflecting on the past 7 weeks and how the world has changed around us, the one thing that hasn't changed is how proud I am to work for Costa. 

I've been blown away at how amazing Costa have been not only to our Key Workers, but more so how our teams have been looked after and will continue to be once we start to open more stores. 

The Leadership and Support during this time has been world class!  

As we start to open back up in the new world I am looking forward to opening our doors, welcoming our teams and get back to doing what we do best! Creating perfect handcrafted coffee in a safe environment for our teams and customer! 

Our teams across the country have done a tremendous job over the past few weeks setting up and preparing for our new ways of working. 

The enthusiasm, leadership and passion shown by all has been truly amazing!

"This article attacks straight-on what I believewill prove to be a distinguishing feature between the companies that will survive and thrive during this time versus those that will become further overwhelmed and sink.  

My takeaway sentence:  “It’s about changing “teamwork” from a buzzword to an optimized practice that creates seamless companywide connections.”

"How can we build our Resilience & Growth Mindset Super Power Muscle??
Resilience is the ability to bounce back from unexpected Change, Challenging Times, Adversity, or even Loss. But it is also the ability to thrive & succeed in our modern, fast pace, superficial, artificial, money driven & often times fake+ego driven society.  In leadership, it's the secret sauce for success. A strong mind & unbreakable spirit spiced with a massive portion of Grit will always conquer the world by storm! To be a resilient leader it takes courage, adaptability & the strength to persevere when things don't go your way, when things get really hard & uncomfortable. 
Practice self-care, self-leadership, self-compassion, self-love, & self-respect. During difficult times, it's important that we take care of ourselves inside and outside of work. Resilience is about recovery, bouncing forward not so much endurance. Get appropriate rest, time alone, downtime & support from family, friends & mates, and take time to recharge via working out, meditation or even breathing exercises.  Do whatever it is that makes you feel more grounded again, whatever makes you feel strong, ready & ""gritty""!
