#job as a Software Engineer in less than 60 days.
Hello Network,
 Hope everyone is holding strong in the current situation. For past one and half years, I have learned a lot at SoFi. I switched my gears from front end to backend, started exploring the world of Java, tried my hands with some dev-ops work, and most importantly got mentored by some awesome Senior Developers. I had a complete experience of a Full-stack Developer. Unfortunately, the journey has come to an end and I am laid off due to recent situations.
 Backed by good mentorship and work experience, I feel confident to enter the job market again. The thing that scares me the most is the timeline to find my new venture. Being an International student, my existence in the United States is tied to my active employment. So, I have 60 days to find a new job. 
I request all of you to present me opportunities related to the software development domain (backend, frontend, or full-stack). I would like to try with the best of my abilities. Any form of help, from just liking this post to giving potential leads is greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
 Rasika
