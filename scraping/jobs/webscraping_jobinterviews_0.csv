"Preparing for a job interview?

Look for clues in the job description to find the types of questions the interviewer could ask. Specifically, look for the pain points of the job and specific qualifications that they may be looking for.

Take the job requirements and flip them into behavioral interview questions. 

Here are a few examples: 

- Find, engage and activate passive candidates through the use of Boolean, LinkedIn and alternative search techniques (sourcing technical recruiter job description)

ðŸ”† Tell me about a time that you used Boolean, LinkedIn or alternative search techniques to find a hard to find candidate. How did you find the job seeker and walk me through how you built a relationship with them.

- Mitigate risks to maximize product availability while minimizing supply chain costs with specific and actionable recommendations. (Supply manager job description)

ðŸ”… Tell me about a specific time that you were able to mitigate risks while maximizing product availability and minimizing supply chain costs. What were the results?

Your ability to tell stories in the interview will help you connect with the hiring managers.

"Every race has a finish line but getting to the finish line requires some form of determination, focus and consistency. I thank God for walking me through the completion of my Master's degree program in Engineering technology at Austin Peay State University.
It was a challenging and impactful program that gave me the opportunity to broaden my engineering and technological know-how.
I want to say thank you to my professor/supervisor, Adel Salama for his ceaseless encouragement and support during the course of the program and to all other professors; Dr Chin-Zue Chen, Dr John Blake, Dr John Byrd, Roger Voorhis, Stephen Kowalski, Dr Samuel Jator among others for relentlessly pouring out their best to impart me academically and also to prepare me for the industrial tasks ahead.
My solemn gratitude also goes to my friends/well wishers; Hafiz Matti, KAZEEM TIJANI, Yusuf Onayemi, Olamide Arolambo, Izuwa Ahanor, Dupe Oyediran, Dismas Ezechukwu, Wasiu Shittu, Mark Ikhifa, Ahmed Aliyu among others. Thanks for believing in me and I truly cherish every moment I had with everyone of you.
At present, I am available in the job market and actively seeking full-time opportunities in Cloud computing, DevOps engineering and systems engineering.
