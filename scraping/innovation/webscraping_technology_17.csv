"Women are amazing.
Ehi, wait a minute, we already knew that! 

What our society doesn't want to admit is that rarely we have the chance to take credit for what we do. Men have always been in the spotlight, women at their back.

I think it's high time to change this negative version of society into one more inclusive to empower women. And you? What do you think about it?

"*Did you know* | Scheduling management in a hospital environment represents a puzzle with thousands of pieces for schedulers. They often must apply 5 basic factors to create a master schedule: shift management, absence management, compliance to business rules, collective agreements, and equity. For example, in a hospital with over 2,000 nurses the creation of a basic schedule represents a puzzle of at least 10,000 pieces ‚Äî and that is with a minimum of personal requests. 

Discover how to simplify scheduling management in a hospital environment

"Ever wondered how a live casino works? Or what kind of technology is used in live gaming?

Live casinos are relatively a new form of gambling that represent the action that takes place in a traditional casino. 

However, live casinos give the player the freedom to place their wager from their humble abode while giving the chance to win more money. 

Contrary to the belief, live casinos and normal casinos both have the same payback percentages. 

Reliable live casinos use popular software such as Realtime Gaming, Microgaming, Amaya Gaming, Playtech, etc. 

What makes this form of gambling so exciting is that the games are played in real-time and include a dealer making it a very realistic experience.

"The Giant Planet Story is the Story of the Solar System.

Juno is improving our understanding of the solar system's beginnings by unlocking the secrets of the origin and evolution of Jupiter.

""Theories about solar system formation all begin with the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust, or nebula, most of which formed the infant sun. Like the sun, Jupiter is mostly hydrogen and helium, so it must have formed early, capturing most of the material left after our star came to be. How this happened, however, is unclear. Did a massive planetary core form first and gravitationally capture all that gas, or did an unstable region collapse inside the nebula, triggering the planet's formation? Differences between these scenarios are profound."" - NASA

June launched in 2011 and arrived at Jupiter in July of 2016. Its end of mission and deorbit is slated for July 2021.

Recently, NASA released 30 absolutely stunning images captured by Juno. This video pieces together thousands of pictures shot by JunoCam to recreate Juno's perspective of the planet from the spacecraft's flyby. The colour and contrast of the images have been enhanced to reveal the beautiful, swirling clouds of Jupiter's stormy atmosphere.

Enjoy the video :)

"Technology has changed the way we work and companies have to adapt to the ever-changing world by thinking outside the box and to gain competitive advantage. In a country where the population is over 1.3 billion, using technology to elevate customer experience is the way, moving forward. Vinayak, who is a very dear friend and also the CEO of Tsalla Aerospace has achieved an unimaginable feat during this time of crisis by serving the needy and supplying medications by maintaining social distancing protocols. 

This is also an example of how a project (drone) that was initially designed for military use could be scaled down and redesigned to achieve a different objective. 

Personally, I am extremely proud of him and would like to thank him for helping out the community in this time of crisis.

"One of the great things about the Railmonitor solution is how robust it is compared to other systems. 

It measures in any kind of weather and can also withstand heavy vibrations caused by rolling stock and heavy machinery. 

Below is a picture of a site in Culemborg in the Netherlands. The solution was installed last summer and has been an integrated part of the railway stretch since then. 

The picture was taken shortly after a visit from a tamping machine. As you can see, the sensor is still tightly fastened to the railway sleeper and the system is still working impeccably. 

Do you need a robust solution for your railway? Well, your wish is our command! Feel free to reach out to Anders Lund Christensen at alc@railmonitor.dk and find out how we can help you üëá

#LoyalWingman is here! The first military aircraft to be designed and built in Australia in more than 50 years has been rolled out as part of a partnership between Royal Australian Air Force and Boeing. 

The Loyal Wingman will have a range of more than 3,700 kilometres, enabling Defence to better understand how these types of aircraft can be used as a force-multiplier, helping to project power forward while keeping manned capabilities out of harm‚Äôs way.

Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the partnership allowed Defence to bring innovation to Australia in an exciting, future-focused technology space.

‚ÄúThe program will examine how autonomous unmanned aircraft can support existing manned aircraft, such as our Joint Strike Fighters, Super Hornets and Growlers,‚Äù Minister Reynolds said. ‚ÄúThis is Australian ingenuity at its finest, and presents Australia and our allies with opportunities for critical capabilities to fight emerging global threat systems.‚Äù

"Harshil Mathur Shashank Kumar
It was unfortunate for SiashMed when it decided to use the service of Razorpay as its payment gateway provider.
Having raised a complaint for 15 days and continous follow ups via mail regarding a payment issue, Razorpay sent the questionnaire form yesterday asking details of the games offered and payments done thereafter. The worst part is, they always revert on mail saying issue will be resolved in 8 hours.
Now my question is that the company doesn't even know who their client is and what it is dealing in. The healthcare company 
SiashMed is being given questionnaire of gaming to resolve its issue.
Kindly don't offer services if you are unable to provide, if providing kindly check your client's details before proceeding.
Being a startup with good technology and fundings, this pathetic service was unexpected.
Issue still unresolved.
I am amazed!!!
