"Promoting innovative behavior of your employees is vital if your organization wants to survive in our ever‐changing global environment.

What is an employee innovative behavior?
It is collection of actions and attitudes that promote innovation, such as, generating creative and novel ideas and proactively act to implement them. 

A research that was lately published (link below) emphasize the importance of feedback in the quest for the innovation behaviors.  
Not only the manager feedback, but also, the feedback from co-workers. 

Supportive feedbacks are those who help the employee to learn and improve. Those feedbacks increasing the employee engagement and promote the individual innovative behavior. 

What happened if the manager feedback is bad or non? It might decrease the innovative behavior. In those cases, supportive feedbacks from co-workers may ease this negative effect.

"With IBM's work in AI and Blockchain it does have the first movers advantage, with millions of dollar only in patent royalties I wonder if the COVID 19 situation effects their patents enough to knock them off their metaphorical throne.
