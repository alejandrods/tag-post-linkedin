"I've been asked a few times recently about recently about infographics and how they can be used to help tell a story. There are lots of ways this can be done, but coming from a video/animation perspective, then using them in an animated way to bring life to facts and figures makes perfect sense. In response to the question, I've put together this short video which demonstrates a few techniques at the same time as giving a positive message about the growing importance of video. Using, just two colours, a bit of research and some audio, this is just one version of what can be achieved. Mix this with actual video footage, a voiceover or just leave as stand alone, this could be right for your business.

"Think there's way too many webinars these days? I agree. 

Are we still recommending our clients do them? Absolutely. 

Webinar overload is very real, but this ON24 article has it right. 

Our clients are still pulling in big numbers for their webinar attendance, but it's because you need to provide value - not just the same information as everyone else. 

1. Bring in experts
2. Provide CLE or CPE credit or CEUs
3. Show how to handle complex issues - there's a lot of new information these days. Break it down and make it easy to understand

If you're doing webinars or thinking about, worth a read.

"I see virtual event as another platform for conducting events. It is just a rotation from a venue to a digital screen. The part facing the sun now has a digital screen. Since time demands the platform now, we should embrace it. Coz the world just cannot stop. Let‚Äôs adopt it and we never know that in future, in any corner of the world where an in-person event is not possible, a virtual event could be the only solution.

"In some ways, being invited on the The Disruptor Series podcast by the great Rob Schwartz was inevitable. After all, Snoop Dogg *was* a former guest. (Or Calvin, to give him his non-canine name.)

In many, many more ways, however, it was flattering beyond words to guest.

We talk about how

"The cure for 
hashtag
#writing anxiety?

In 2019, after a decade of grit, Michael Werwie finally made it as a screenwriter. His 13th script, a Ted Bundy biopic, premiered at Sundance. And then it headlined on Netflix.

He had found success! But his angst lingered:

‚ÄúEvery new project feels like it's the first time I've ever written,‚Äù said Werwie. ‚ÄúLike the last movie was just a fluke, and the imposter syndrome is real.‚Äù

Poignant reminder that even professional 
hashtag
#writers feel anxious about their ability. 

Maybe you know the feeling? I know I do.

And the cure?

Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure one exists.

I think a degree of self-doubt is baked into the discipline. And all you can really do is learn to anticipate the angst, and embrace it when it comes, and convert that bad energy into good energy, creative energy, productive energy. 

‚ÄúOK but how, Eddie? Convert it how??‚Äù

Again, not sure.

That is, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a set playbook. We‚Äôre all different. And a big part of becoming a 
hashtag
#writer is just doing it enough to find YOUR process. And the only way to find it is by showing up, by making writing a daily habit. THIS I‚Äôm sure of. 

Whether you do

"No 'new normal'?

""Every big event shifts and shapes our behaviour. A ‚Äònew normal‚Äô however is one where the operating system itself undergoes a change ‚Äì like redefining the future of work or journalism or advertising or urban commutes and I somehow feel those notions are premature and overstated"": Karthik Nagarajan in ET Brand Equity today. 

In this exclusive piece for BE, Nagarajan, chief content officer, Wavemaker, wonders if there will be ""a new normal"" after the lockdown lifts. The answer, he believes, is 'No'.

"Unlocking LinkedIn

I didnt know the power of linkedIn until i started using it for my own business  and closing high valued leads.

Its truly exceptional especially for B2B marketing.I am not even talking about running ads on LinkedIn; Personally I find them very expensive.I am talking about generating organic traffic , networking with your Target audience, sending them high valued solutions for their urgency  and then closing deals.

Who do you trust? 

How do you know their strategy will work for your business? 

Is now the right time? 

What if you just don't like them? üò≥

We've found businesses have these doubts (plus more) when choosing a partner to help their business grow.

The right partner for you should be able to bring your concerns to light and work with you to address them. 

Keep in mind, successful agencies will be vetting you too. 

As an agency your success is our success. 

We want to enter into a partnership that is mutually beneficial.

"WHY IT‚ÄôS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE MARKETING DURING A CRISIS. PART 2‚ö†Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre an e-commerce business, NOW is the time you want to utilise Social Media Advertising to push online product sales. üìà

üíª Customer buying behaviour has dramatically shifted further in favour of buying online. 

üìâ Physical storefront sales will continue to decline even after lockdown is lifted. 

üí° Many of your competitors are choosing to STOP their marketing budgets, meaning you can now generate a better ROI at a cheaper cost! (less players on the field!)

This month, one of our our e-commerce clients are seeing great ROI. They continue to invest during a period where the demand for e-commerce products are flying! üöÄ
May‚Äôs Facebook Ads results from just one our campaigns so far:

‚úÖ 104 purchases so far in May
‚úÖ Total advertising spend = ¬£298
‚úÖ Total revenue GENERATED = ¬£2057

"We‚Äôre all making the best of a bad situation, and that includes maintaining your brand‚Äôs online presence. Find out the five strategies to boost your social proof today.

1. Boost your own platform and ask people to be a part of it. Engage with other people to help you get there. 

2. Network via social media. Consider having a virtual coffee session with someone who is vying for your time. It can yield a return more significant than you‚Äôd expect.

3. Engage influencers with a Call-to-Action. Choose influencers who you know will want to engage with your content, and tag them on your posts or videos.

4. Tell engaging stories to your followers. Every story needs a human touch, and you might never  know who your content will reach to.

5. Offer perks in exchange for purchase testimonials. Buyer decisions are influenced by what they read from others. Offer an incentive for your buyers to leave a review.

"IMO-2020 in Shipping Industry :- Scrubbers shall still pay off despite narrowing spread between VLSFO(<0.5%) & HSFO(<3.5%) 
Following opportunities can be exploited with details in this post,
‚óè There shall be increased demand for Scrubbers, as only 17% ships have been fitted with Scrubbers so far out of 60000 ships in the world.
‚óè Companies offering Scrubbers at a lower price shall have an edge as Shipowners are under tremendous pressure due to losses on account of Covid19. 
Please read on....
‚ñ™Ô∏éIn 2019 Industry planned for VLSFO use from Jan20 to meet emissions norms.
‚ñ™Ô∏éIt was expected that HSFO prices would fall & VLSFO prices will rise due to increased demand. Spread (PMT) between 2 fuels was projected  around 200$ in 20-21, 450$ in 21-22 & around 135 $ in 24-25 due to increased  demand of HSFO after retrofitting of Scrubbers on ships.
‚ñ™Ô∏éHowever due to COVID19, VLSFO demand is on decline whereas the demand of HSFO has been stable resulting in reduced spread of 95 $ in Mar20 against 300$ in Jan20.
‚ñ™Ô∏éDespite lower spread, the investment payback period for Scrubbers may be 6-18 months, depending on the cost of Scrubber & daily consumption of HSFO which results in substantial savings on Fuel costs.

"No 'new normal'?

""Every big event shifts and shapes our behaviour. A ‚Äònew normal‚Äô however is one where the operating system itself undergoes a change ‚Äì like redefining the future of work or journalism or advertising or urban commutes and I somehow feel those notions are premature and overstated"": Karthik Nagarajan in ET Brand Equity today. 

In this exclusive piece for BE, Nagarajan, chief content officer, Wavemaker, wonders if there will be ""a new normal"" after the lockdown lifts. The answer, he believes, is 'No'.

"The traditional financial advisor is not allowed to help you keep your money, that is, from taxes.  ‚ÄúWe can not give you tax advice,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúbecause we are not accountants.‚Äù 

(FOR THE RECORD You should always consult a licensed accountant before making any tax decisions.)

So let me get this straight.  Most financial experts agree that the biggest expense over our lifetime is taxes.  Warren Buffet teach that the first rule of wealth building is ‚Äòdon‚Äôt lose money.‚Äô  Even so, the traditional advisor then can not help you here???  So that means you are left with going to your accountants, many of whom are not paid to give advice but to file your paperwork.  I think this is nuts.  This is why it is maddening that so many people mindlessly turn over their money to the traditional financial advisors when in doing so they are losing out on strategies that will help them RETAIN more of their wealth.  Tell them to beat it.

"Finding and choosing to work with an agency for your business can feel daunting. 

Who do you trust? 

How do you know their strategy will work for your business? 

Is now the right time? 

What if you just don't like them? üò≥

We've found businesses have these doubts (plus more) when choosing a partner to help their business grow.

The right partner for you should be able to bring your concerns to light and work with you to address them. 

Keep in mind, successful agencies will be vetting you too. 

As an agency your success is our success. 

We want to enter into a partnership that is mutually beneficial. 

Here's a <2 min highlight from my conversation with Dan Ritzke of Third Act Marketing. We talk about how the right partner can make a business owner's life easier and how simple goals will lead to  success.

Gary V says you need to be everywhere...

However, you can only cover as much with your time.

But the truth is that, in the information era, content is king.

And distribution is queen.

For that, I would love to see where else you guys are pushing content.

In my case, it is Facebook organic and paid, whereas Instagram is more of a broader audience net.

Of course, all of that leading to a sales funnel we are still working on.

What about you guys?

As the government played a vital role in the economy, therefore it is crucial for central and each of the regional governments to understand and develop SPA (servicing/surviving, preparing, and actualizing) plans. For areas that have been infected by the COVID-19, the regional government should have a surviving plan, while areas that have not been infected can service and prepare.

"If you're looking for a great Headline to use today (for copy, an email, or video)....try this one:

(I directly stole this from ""Breakthrough Advertising"" by Eugene Schwartz):

""Give Me One Evening and I'll Give You a Push-Button Memory"" - What a FANTASTIC line! 

Here's what makes it impactful:

1. It implies an immediate benefit: A better memory.
2. It's very specific on what you get: A ""push-button"" memory.
3. It shows the time-frame you can get results: In one evening. 
4. It's a clear trade: You give me THIS..... I give you THAT in return.
5. Kind of sums up the entire thing.... in one little sentence. 

So you can apply it to your own business in many ways:

1. ""Give me two hours, and I'll show you how to get 4 dates a week.""
2. ""Trade us one weekend, and we'll show you how to double your real estate leads.""
3. ""Trade me 47 bucks, and I'll show you how I made a digital product that sold 20,000 copies""
4. ""For the cost of a large pizza, I'll let give you a personal tour inside my $250,000/year internet business"" 
huh?  

You can experiment with this headline. But use it wisely, my friend :-)

"WHY IT‚ÄôS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE MARKETING DURING A CRISIS. PART 2‚ö†Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre an e-commerce business, NOW is the time you want to utilise Social Media Advertising to push online product sales. üìà

üíª Customer buying behaviour has dramatically shifted further in favour of buying online. 

üìâ Physical storefront sales will continue to decline even after lockdown is lifted. 

üí° Many of your competitors are choosing to STOP their marketing budgets, meaning you can now generate a better ROI at a cheaper cost! (less players on the field!)

This month, one of our our e-commerce clients are seeing great ROI. They continue to invest during a period where the demand for e-commerce products are flying! üöÄ
May‚Äôs Facebook Ads results from just one our campaigns so far:

‚úÖ 104 purchases so far in May
‚úÖ Total advertising spend = ¬£298
‚úÖ Total revenue GENERATED = ¬£2057

If you have any questions about how your business can generate MORE e-commerce sales, then feel free to send me a direct message!üì©

"The cure for 
#writing anxiety?

In 2019, after a decade of grit, Michael Werwie finally made it as a screenwriter. His 13th script, a Ted Bundy biopic, premiered at Sundance. And then it headlined on Netflix.

He had found success! But his angst lingered:

‚ÄúEvery new project feels like it's the first time I've ever written,‚Äù said Werwie. ‚ÄúLike the last movie was just a fluke, and the imposter syndrome is real.‚Äù

Poignant reminder that even professional 
#writers feel anxious about their ability. 

Maybe you know the feeling? I know I do.

And the cure?

Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure one exists.

I think a degree of self-doubt is baked into the discipline. And all you can really do is learn to anticipate the angst, and embrace it when it comes, and convert that bad energy into good energy, creative energy, productive energy. 

‚ÄúOK but how, Eddie? Convert it how??‚Äù

Again, not sure.

That is, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a set playbook. We‚Äôre all different. And a big part of becoming a 
#writer is just doing it enough to find YOUR process. And the only way to find it is by showing up, by making writing a daily habit. THIS I‚Äôm sure of. 

Whether you do 
#screenwriting or 
#copywriting or anything else, walk the same steps each day and you‚Äôll eventually forge a path you can depend on.

"The best thing you can do in the face of total uncertainty is innovate.

Now is the time to improvise, experiment, iterate, innovate.

Start with the foundation of your company‚Äîyour brand‚Äîand expand through your business from there.

Re-evaluate the underlying belief that drives your business; your brand purpose. Is it still relevant today? If not, how could you iterate on it or reframe it so that your purpose resonates with consumers now?

Re-imagine your product or service for new audiences and new needs. How can you deliver an experience that people want now? What new form could it take? Is there a new way you could deliver your product or service to your customers?

Create a whole new approach to pricing that removes barriers from trying your product or service. What low risk incentives could you offer?

Approach marketing from a completely different perspective. Could you use strategic partnerships? Mobilize passionate loyalists? Would a targeted, geographic focus make sense?

"History determines our actions for tomorrow. Hence, I wrote my mind down about the evolution of one of the most lucrative fields of marketing - Brand Experience. Within this article, I discuss how the ""age of products"" is collaborating with experiential technologies to create the brands of tomorrow. Brands that believe in creating value by getting involved with their customers through personal experiences.

"In some ways, being invited on the The Disruptor Series podcast by the great Rob Schwartz was inevitable. After all, Snoop Dogg *was* a former guest. (Or Calvin, to give him his non-canine name.)

In many, many more ways, however, it was flattering beyond words to guest.

We talk about how 
#ISOLATEDTalks started. And how it's subsequently serving up presentations, talks and stories from some of the adland's most inspiring people. All with the mission to help people get through this crisis and support Samaritans. 

Other topics include my agency, ...Gasp!, our role in collaborating with and publishing Ryan Wallman's The Drum Roses Award winning book ""Delusions of Brandeur"", how Tim Williams is a genius when it comes to pricing creativity, why we should all fail a little more and <breathe> a bit more in between.

"Circuit-breaker ""Moz""-have: Free upskilling

Pretty late to it, but Moz is free for the next 15 days till 31st May for SEO 101. 

Moz has always been my number one introduction when it comes to people understanding what it is about. It has great visuals, outstanding summary, and easy-to-grasp examples. Pity on the keyword, ""SEO"" they always rank right below Neil Patel on the SERP. 

 Thanks to Vania for letting me know about this! Great stuff.

"Now is the time to use direct mail üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Brands shouldn't just send something for the sake of sending it, but now is the time to talk to your customers through DM. 

Since working from home for the past 8 weeks I have received only transactional mail through my letterbox! Brands have a huge opportunity to speak directly to there customers away from all the noise!

"I had a lovely virtual coffee date with Khatija Qureshi yesterday! It's always great catching up! 

We talked about digital marketing, pivoting in these times, how we're doing our best to keep in touch and making it a point to connect with our network on a regular basis. We talked about working from home and plans for the rest of the year. 

I am always in awe of her wisdom and generosity when it comes to helping others. If you are a newcomer to Canada and would like to learn more about how she can help, don't be shy to connect with her.

"I've been asked a few times recently about recently about infographics and how they can be used to help tell a story. There are lots of ways this can be done, but coming from a video/animation perspective, then using them in an animated way to bring life to facts and figures makes perfect sense. In response to the question, I've put together this short video which demonstrates a few techniques at the same time as giving a positive message about the growing importance of video. Using, just two colours, a bit of research and some audio, this is just one version of what can be achieved. Mix this with actual video footage, a voiceover or just leave as stand alone, this could be right for your business.

"Think there's way too many webinars these days? I agree. 

Are we still recommending our clients do them? Absolutely. 

Webinar overload is very real, but this ON24 article has it right. 

Our clients are still pulling in big numbers for their webinar attendance, but it's because you need to provide value - not just the same information as everyone else. 

1. Bring in experts
2. Provide CLE or CPE credit or CEUs
3. Show how to handle complex issues - there's a lot of new information these days. Break it down and make it easy to understand

If you're doing webinars or thinking about, worth a read.

"I see virtual event as another platform for conducting events. It is just a rotation from a venue to a digital screen. The part facing the sun now has a digital screen. Since time demands the platform now, we should embrace it. Coz the world just cannot stop. Let‚Äôs adopt it and we never know that in future, in any corner of the world where an in-person event is not possible, a virtual event could be the only solution.

#hottake on Star Wars Marketing üî•Baby Yoda was the biggest marketing fail of 2019. Here's why:


üëâThe Mandalorian was released on November 12, 2019 üöÄ

üëâThe Child, aka Baby Yoda, became an online sensation within HOURS of the show's launch üí•

üëâNo official merchandise was available for US Black Friday (November 27)

üëâNo official merchandise ready for peak holiday shopping dates in the US (December 1-15, Deloitte, graph included in comment) 
üí•Search rates for Baby Yoda PEAKED during this window! (see Google Trends picture)

Where did consumers go instead?

üëâEtsy, Redbubble, Amazon, Society6...

üò±Hasbro is only launching an official line of Baby Yoda merch THIS MONTH (May 2020) DisneyStore had a Baby Yoda product line available at the beginning of 2020. 

I'm still wondering why Disney, the experts on character launches (look at Frozen 2's ‚ùÖ launch + new character look turnover) wasn't ready with products to support a character DESIGNED and WRITTEN for audiences to love ü§î

In a land far, far away... üåç

Yes, you heard that right;

Imagine a marketing platform where competition is close to NONE.

A platform full of those ""bottom of the funnel"" pre-qualified leads that are not only in the loop but also much more likely to buy.

It exists,
