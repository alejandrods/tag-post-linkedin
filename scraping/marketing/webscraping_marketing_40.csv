"COVID-19 can last up to 72 hours on stainless steel surfaces like the metal wall box. Studies  also found that not only are metal wall boxes in restroom stalls covered in bacteria and mold, but they can be the dirtiest surface in the restroom. 

Citron’s Personal Hygiene Disposal Units are the safest, way to limit cross-contamination when disposing of your hygiene products. With businesses starting to reopen, ensure your washroom is completely touch-free to stop the spread.

"I've been asked a few times recently about recently about infographics and how they can be used to help tell a story. There are lots of ways this can be done, but coming from a video/animation perspective, then using them in an animated way to bring life to facts and figures makes perfect sense. In response to the question, I've put together this short video which demonstrates a few techniques at the same time as giving a positive message about the growing importance of video. Using, just two colours, a bit of research and some audio, this is just one version of what can be achieved. Mix this with actual video footage, a voiceover or just leave as stand alone, this could be right for your business.

"Agree. Looking back I formed Creative direction & Art direction for Lexus, Hyundai, designed brand identity for local brands, as well as grew brands international ecommerce and marketing performance by data and acquisition driven strategies.

I once got asked if we digital marketers can really handle both brand/ creatives and growth since they’re so opposite. My answer is YES. It’s not about how opposite they’re against each other. It’s more about how you balance both of them and connect each other and maximise the results you want to achieve."
"The Covid19 pandemic has proved to us without a doubt that we need to not just utilize but also maximize digital technology to be successful in this ever-changing world.

"We can't imagine anything worse than having a child so sick that they need to be in the hospital for care.  There are so many things running through your mind -- what's going on, what's the treatment, when will they get better... and if you don't live close to Charlotte or the hospital your child is in... where can I stay, and how long will I be able to do that?  Ronald McDonald House Charities relieve some of that burden for parents by giving families a place to stay while their children are in the hospital. Kristin Young from Ronald McDonald House of Charlotte  joins us to tell us what's going on there right now on this episode of the Award-Winning BrandBuilders Podcast...

"Think there's way too many webinars these days? I agree. 

Are we still recommending our clients do them? Absolutely. 

Webinar overload is very real, but this ON24 article has it right. 

Our clients are still pulling in big numbers for their webinar attendance, but it's because you need to provide value - not just the same information as everyone else. 

1. Bring in experts
2. Provide CLE or CPE credit or CEUs
3. Show how to handle complex issues - there's a lot of new information these days. Break it down and make it easy to understand

If you're doing webinars or thinking about, worth a read.

Learning doesn't stop and now's the perfect opportunity to start investing in myself. There are so many free online resources available to help you explore your interests, and you can also reach out to professionals in a field you're curious about to ask some questions. Utilize LinkedIn and go build some relationships with the people you want to work with eventually!

"In my adjacent career as a sponsored competitive shooter I'm often asked by my consulting clients how they can get influencers to better represent their products in their ""influencer marketing"" campaigns. 

Well, influencer marketing is a media buy. Sometimes with money, sometimes with product, and sometimes with both. But just like in the golden age of TV, campaigns themselves start with the selection of the right media. 

Unlike TV shows though, influencers need to be believable, and the use of the products needs to be genuine. So product placement must contain three essential elements:

1) Utility: The product needs to be useful to the influencer whose audience you are attempting to reach. Otherwise, nobody is being influenced to buy anything.

2) Context: Content itself needs to be natural, and applied within the regular goings-on of the influencer's content. It cannot be forced. If the product doesn't fit the influencer's passion, it turns into a TV commercial, and all credibility goes out the window.

3) Consistency: In order to be believable, the product needs to be used over time by the influencer for the audience to trust that the product is also good enough for them. Otherwise, they are NOT going to bite.

"The cure for 
hashtag
#writing anxiety?

In 2019, after a decade of grit, Michael Werwie finally made it as a screenwriter. His 13th script, a Ted Bundy biopic, premiered at Sundance. And then it headlined on Netflix.

He had found success! But his angst lingered:

“Every new project feels like it's the first time I've ever written,” said Werwie. “Like the last movie was just a fluke, and the imposter syndrome is real.”

Poignant reminder that even professional 
hashtag
#writers feel anxious about their ability. 

Maybe you know the feeling? I know I do.

And the cure?

Honestly, I’m not sure one exists.

I think a degree of self-doubt is baked into the discipline. And all you can really do is learn to anticipate the angst, and embrace it when it comes, and convert that bad energy into good energy, creative energy, productive energy. 

“OK but how, Eddie? Convert it how??”

Again, not sure.

That is, I don’t think there’s a set playbook. We’re all different. And a big part of becoming a 
hashtag
#writer is just doing it enough to find YOUR process. And the only way to find it is by showing up, by making writing a daily habit. THIS I’m sure of. 

Whether you do 
hashtag
#screenwriting or 
hashtag
#copywriting or anything else, walk the same steps each day and you’ll eventually forge a path you can depend on.

"No 'new normal'?

""Every big event shifts and shapes our behaviour. A ‘new normal’ however is one where the operating system itself undergoes a change – like redefining the future of work or journalism or advertising or urban commutes and I somehow feel those notions are premature and overstated"": Karthik Nagarajan in ET Brand Equity today. 

In this exclusive piece for BE, Nagarajan, chief content officer, Wavemaker, wonders if there will be ""a new normal"" after the lockdown lifts. The answer, he believes, is 'No'.

"COVID-19 can last up to 72 hours on stainless steel surfaces like the metal wall box. Studies also found that not only are metal wall boxes in washroom stalls covered in bacteria and mold, but they can be the dirtiest surface in the washroom. 

Citron’s Personal Hygiene Disposal Units are the safest way to limit cross-contamination when disposing of your hygiene products. With businesses starting to reopen, ensure your washroom is completely touch-free to stop the spread.

According to Simon Sinek, most companies have no idea why customers choose their products. So, they communicate from 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘪.𝘦 "" 𝙒𝙃𝘼𝙏 - 𝙃𝙊𝙒 - 𝙒𝙃𝙔 ""

On the other hand, Successful companies communicate in the exact reverse order, 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘴𝘪𝘥𝘦 𝘪.𝘦 "" 𝙒𝙃𝙔 - 𝙃𝙊𝙒 - 𝙒𝙃𝘼𝙏 ""

𝘍𝘰𝘳 𝘦𝘨 : 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗲 starts with the 𝗪𝗛𝗬, the centre of the Golden Circle. So instead of communicating what they do or how they do, 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝘆𝗲𝗿𝘀.

"Finding and choosing to work with an agency for your business can feel daunting. 

Who do you trust? 

How do you know their strategy will work for your business? 

Is now the right time? 

What if you just don't like them? 😳

We've found businesses have these doubts (plus more) when choosing a partner to help their business grow.

The right partner for you should be able to bring your concerns to light and work with you to address them. 

Keep in mind, successful agencies will be vetting you too. 

As an agency your success is our success. 

We want to enter into a partnership that is mutually beneficial. 

Here's a <2 min highlight from my conversation with Dan Ritzke of Third Act Marketing. We talk about how the right partner can make a business owner's life easier and how simple goals will lead to  success.

"WHY IT’S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE MARKETING DURING A CRISIS. PART 2⚠️

If you’re an e-commerce business, NOW is the time you want to utilise Social Media Advertising to push online product sales. 📈

💻 Customer buying behaviour has dramatically shifted further in favour of buying online. 

📉 Physical storefront sales will continue to decline even after lockdown is lifted. 

💡 Many of your competitors are choosing to STOP their marketing budgets, meaning you can now generate a better ROI at a cheaper cost! (less players on the field!)

This month, one of our our e-commerce clients are seeing great ROI. They continue to invest during a period where the demand for e-commerce products are flying! 🚀
May’s Facebook Ads results from just one our campaigns so far:

✅ 104 purchases so far in May
✅ Total advertising spend = £298
✅ Total revenue GENERATED = £2057

If you have any questions about how your business can generate MORE e-commerce sales, then feel free to send me a direct message!📩

"I recently got to spend a morning in conversation with the IAS' Johanna McDowell to discuss the challenges that creative agencies would likely face as they tackle a new world after lockdown.

As we all work to define a 'new normal' and get back to real-world face time with clients it is important to keep in mind the fundamentals of building great businesses.

So, whether event agency, PR agency, creative agency, or even as a marketing client, there are some real nuggets in this conversation to help us all do better business, together. (And some great insights that are actually applicable to all businesses...)

Some crucial practices related to the technique are - Keyword research, Search Engine Marketing - the practice of marketing a business using paid advertisements that appear on search engine results pages (or SERPs) and optimizing link structure.

"We’re all making the best of a bad situation, and that includes maintaining your brand’s online presence. Find out the five strategies to boost your social proof today.

1. Boost your own platform and ask people to be a part of it. Engage with other people to help you get there. 

2. Network via social media. Consider having a virtual coffee session with someone who is vying for your time. It can yield a return more significant than you’d expect.

3. Engage influencers with a Call-to-Action. Choose influencers who you know will want to engage with your content, and tag them on your posts or videos.

4. Tell engaging stories to your followers. Every story needs a human touch, and you might never  know who your content will reach to.

5. Offer perks in exchange for purchase testimonials. Buyer decisions are influenced by what they read from others. Offer an incentive for your buyers to leave a review.

And distribution is queen.

For that, I would love to see where else you guys are pushing content.

In my case, it is Facebook organic and paid, whereas Instagram is more of a broader audience net.

"If you want to get buyers to lean in NOW you have to promise a compelling change—a Promised Land you help to create. 

There are 5 elements that will make your promised Land an imperative (with a case study from Drift) 👇

1. Thrive in the new world
2. Difficult to reach w/o your help
3. Defeats the villain you define
4. Facilitates self-actualization and belonging (people like me are transforming like this)
5. Not your platform, but what they GET thanks to the platform

When you define and own a promised land, you'll find that while you never completely escape a competitive set...

People will come to you asking for the result you promise.

They compare, but only out of obligation. 

We can break down Drift's Old Way vs New Way positioning as an example of a promised land done well.

Without them, you are LOSING deals. 

With them:

1. Close more deals
2. Connect with customers the way THEY want (in a way you CAN'T without them)
3. Overcome the villain of complex, form-driven marketing
4. Create better results which = invaluable contributor
5. Not about chat. About happier customers and more $

Your question: What promised land can you create that will make your market have to stop and ask: How do I get there?

Define it, own it, and see your results 🚀

"IMO-2020 in Shipping Industry :- Scrubbers shall still pay off despite narrowing spread between VLSFO(<0.5%) & HSFO(<3.5%) 
Following opportunities can be exploited with details in this post,
● There shall be increased demand for Scrubbers, as only 17% ships have been fitted with Scrubbers so far out of 60000 ships in the world.
● Companies offering Scrubbers at a lower price shall have an edge as Shipowners are under tremendous pressure due to losses on account of Covid19. 
Please read on....
▪︎In 2019 Industry planned for VLSFO use from Jan20 to meet emissions norms.
▪︎It was expected that HSFO prices would fall & VLSFO prices will rise due to increased demand. Spread (PMT) between 2 fuels was projected  around 200$ in 20-21, 450$ in 21-22 & around 135 $ in 24-25 due to increased  demand of HSFO after retrofitting of Scrubbers on ships.
▪︎However due to COVID19, VLSFO demand is on decline whereas the demand of HSFO has been stable resulting in reduced spread of 95 $ in Mar20 against 300$ in Jan20.
▪︎Despite lower spread, the investment payback period for Scrubbers may be 6-18 months, depending on the cost of Scrubber & daily consumption of HSFO which results in substantial savings on Fuel costs.

"No 'new normal'?

""Every big event shifts and shapes our behaviour. A ‘new normal’ however is one where the operating system itself undergoes a change – like redefining the future of work or journalism or advertising or urban commutes and I somehow feel those notions are premature and overstated"": Karthik Nagarajan in ET Brand Equity today. 

In this exclusive piece for BE, Nagarajan, chief content officer, Wavemaker, wonders if there will be ""a new normal"" after the lockdown lifts. The answer, he believes, is 'No'.

"I had the pleasure of chatting to Nabila Marrow and Jacqueline Cripps about the impact of COVID-19 on digital marketing and millennials.

Check it out and let know what you think! Do you think the digital landscape has changed? What's to come in marketing post-pandemic? How have you or your clients been affected?"
"The traditional financial advisor is not allowed to help you keep your money, that is, from taxes.  “We can not give you tax advice,” they say, “because we are not accountants.” 

(FOR THE RECORD You should always consult a licensed accountant before making any tax decisions.)

So let me get this straight.  Most financial experts agree that the biggest expense over our lifetime is taxes.  Warren Buffet teach that the first rule of wealth building is ‘don’t lose money.’  Even so, the traditional advisor then can not help you here???  So that means you are left with going to your accountants, many of whom are not paid to give advice but to file your paperwork.  I think this is nuts.  This is why it is maddening that so many people mindlessly turn over their money to the traditional financial advisors when in doing so they are losing out on strategies that will help them RETAIN more of their wealth.  Tell them to beat it.

"Finding and choosing to work with an agency for your business can feel daunting. 

Who do you trust? 

How do you know their strategy will work for your business? 

Is now the right time? 

What if you just don't like them? 😳

We've found businesses have these doubts (plus more) when choosing a partner to help their business grow.

The right partner for you should be able to bring your concerns to light and work with you to address them. 

Keep in mind, successful agencies will be vetting you too. 

As an agency your success is our success. 

We want to enter into a partnership that is mutually beneficial. 

Here's a <2 min highlight from my conversation with Dan Ritzke of Third Act Marketing. We talk about how the right partner can make a business owner's life easier and how simple goals will lead to  success.

Gary V says you need to be everywhere...

However, you can only cover as much with your time.

But the truth is that, in the information era, content is king.

And distribution is queen.

For that, I would love to see where else you guys are pushing content.

In my case, it is Facebook organic and paid, whereas Instagram is more of a broader audience net.

Of course, all of that leading to a sales funnel we are still working on.

As the government played a vital role in the economy, therefore it is crucial for central and each of the regional governments to understand and develop SPA (servicing/surviving, preparing, and actualizing) plans.

"If you're looking for a great Headline to use today (for copy, an email, or video)....try this one:

(I directly stole this from ""Breakthrough Advertising"" by Eugene Schwartz):

""Give Me One Evening and I'll Give You a Push-Button Memory"" - What a FANTASTIC line! 

Here's what makes it impactful:

1. It implies an immediate benefit: A better memory.
2. It's very specific on what you get: A ""push-button"" memory.
3. It shows the time-frame you can get results: In one evening. 
4. It's a clear trade: You give me THIS..... I give you THAT in return.
5. Kind of sums up the entire thing.... in one little sentence. 

So you can apply it to your own business in many ways:

1. ""Give me two hours, and I'll show you how to get 4 dates a week.""
2. ""Trade us one weekend, and we'll show you how to double your real estate leads.""
3. ""Trade me 47 bucks, and I'll show you how I made a digital product that sold 20,000 copies""
4. ""For the cost of a large pizza, I'll let give you a personal tour inside my $250,000/year internet business"" 
huh?  

You can experiment with this headline. But use it wisely, my friend :-)

"WHY IT’S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE MARKETING DURING A CRISIS. PART 2⚠️

If you’re an e-commerce business, NOW is the time you want to utilise Social Media Advertising to push online product sales. 📈

💻 Customer buying behaviour has dramatically shifted further in favour of buying online. 

📉 Physical storefront sales will continue to decline even after lockdown is lifted. 

💡 Many of your competitors are choosing to STOP their marketing budgets, meaning you can now generate a better ROI at a cheaper cost! (less players on the field!)

This month, one of our our e-commerce clients are seeing great ROI. They continue to invest during a period where the demand for e-commerce products are flying! 🚀
May’s Facebook Ads results from just one our campaigns so far:

✅ 104 purchases so far in May
✅ Total advertising spend = £298
✅ Total revenue GENERATED = £2057

If you have any questions about how your business can generate MORE e-commerce sales, then feel free to send me a direct message!📩

"Whether we realise it or not, the switch from individual to social decision making has always been happening. It's been happening to an extent that most brands need to align themselves to community generated content over user generated individual content. I am more susceptible to buying something that someone else has got rather than realising my need for something and getting it. Virtually everyone on the globe will be connected really soon, and this trend is likely to never stop growing!

"The cure for 
#writing anxiety?

In 2019, after a decade of grit, Michael Werwie finally made it as a screenwriter. His 13th script, a Ted Bundy biopic, premiered at Sundance. And then it headlined on Netflix.

He had found success! But his angst lingered:

“Every new project feels like it's the first time I've ever written,” said Werwie. “Like the last movie was just a fluke, and the imposter syndrome is real.”

Poignant reminder that even professional 
#writers feel anxious about their ability. 

Maybe you know the feeling? I know I do.

And the cure?

Honestly, I’m not sure one exists.

I think a degree of self-doubt is baked into the discipline. And all you can really do is learn to anticipate the angst, and embrace it when it comes, and convert that bad energy into good energy, creative energy, productive energy. 

“OK but how, Eddie? Convert it how??”

Again, not sure.

That is, I don’t think there’s a set playbook. We’re all different. And a big part of becoming a 
#writer is just doing it enough to find YOUR process. And the only way to find it is by showing up, by making writing a daily habit. THIS I’m sure of. 

Whether you do 
#screenwriting or 
#copywriting or anything else, walk the same steps each day and you’ll eventually forge a path you can depend on.

"You have only 8 seconds to read this

What if I told you that you are likely to lose attention from this post within the next 8 seconds. My time is up, but looks like I still have your attention so lest keep going. Its is interesting to know that the average attention span of people is 8 seconds, this means that in communicating with your customers you have only 8 seconds to catch their attention. 

You must be thinking how on earth is this possible but the truth is for some category of customers it takes less than 8 seconds to catch their attention. Customers are busy people who barely have time to spare in this age of technology and information. The ubiquitous spread of information across the media makes it very difficult to catch the full attention of customers. A text message notification from your partner recieved now can take your attention away from this post. So you see how easily it is for customers to be distracted and lose attention from your content. 

To create content that can beat the 8 seconds rule you must first of all research your target audience to know who they are, their needs, their interest, what drives their passion, their ambitions, what excites them etc.
Next you have to create a theme for your content.... (continued in next post)

"The best thing you can do in the face of total uncertainty is innovate.

Now is the time to improvise, experiment, iterate, innovate.

Start with the foundation of your company—your brand—and expand through your business from there.

Re-evaluate the underlying belief that drives your business; your brand purpose. Is it still relevant today? If not, how could you iterate on it or reframe it so that your purpose resonates with consumers now?

Re-imagine your product or service for new audiences and new needs. How can you deliver an experience that people want now? What new form could it take? Is there a new way you could deliver your product or service to your customers?

Create a whole new approach to pricing that removes barriers from trying your product or service. What low risk incentives could you offer?

Approach marketing from a completely different perspective. Could you use strategic partnerships? Mobilize passionate loyalists? Would a targeted, geographic focus make sense?

Come up with one bold idea to transform your business in this moment. Share your ideas here. Let’s learn from each other.

"I've been asked a few times recently about recently about infographics and how they can be used to help tell a story. There are lots of ways this can be done, but coming from a video/animation perspective, then using them in an animated way to bring life to facts and figures makes perfect sense. In response to the question, I've put together this short video which demonstrates a few techniques at the same time as giving a positive message about the growing importance of video. Using, just two colours, a bit of research and some audio, this is just one version of what can be achieved. Mix this with actual video footage, a voiceover or just leave as stand alone, this could be right for your business.

Webinar overload is very real, but this ON24 article has it right. 

Our clients are still pulling in big numbers for their webinar attendance, but it's because you need to provide value - not just the same information as everyone else. 

1. Bring in experts
2. Provide CLE or CPE credit or CEUs
3. Show how to handle complex issues - there's a lot of new information these days. Break it down and make it easy to understand

#hottake on Star Wars Marketing 🔥Baby Yoda was the biggest marketing fail of 2019. Here's why:


👉The Mandalorian was released on November 12, 2019 🚀

👉The Child, aka Baby Yoda, became an online sensation within HOURS of the show's launch 💥

👉No official merchandise was available for US Black Friday (November 27)

👉No official merchandise ready for peak holiday shopping dates in the US (December 1-15, Deloitte, graph included in comment) 
💥Search rates for Baby Yoda PEAKED during this window! (see Google Trends picture)

Where did consumers go instead?

👉Etsy, Redbubble, Amazon, Society6...

😱Hasbro is only launching an official line of Baby Yoda merch THIS MONTH (May 2020) DisneyStore had a Baby Yoda product line available at the beginning of 2020. 

I'm still wondering why Disney, the experts on character launches (look at Frozen 2's ❅ launch + new character look turnover) wasn't ready with products to support a character DESIGNED and WRITTEN for audiences to love 🤔
