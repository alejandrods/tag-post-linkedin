Interesting sharing about posting valuable content from Kylie Francis ! üëçüèª
"Are you guys really using the potential of all social media environments?

Gary V says you need to be everywhere...

However, you can only cover as much with your time.

But the truth is that, in the information era, content is king.

And distribution is queen.

For that, I would love to see where else you guys are pushing content.

In my case, it is Facebook organic and paid, whereas Instagram is more of a broader audience net.

Of course, all of that leading to a sales funnel we are still working on.

What about you guys?

"I definitely need to do better with many of these tips. Thanks for sharing, Roopal! The one I really need to focus on is turning the phone off at bedtime. What is one that should be a focus for you?"
