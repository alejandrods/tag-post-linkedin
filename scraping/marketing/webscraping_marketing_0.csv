"Are you guys really using the potential of all social media environments?

Gary V says you need to be everywhere...

However, you can only cover as much with your time.

But the truth is that, in the information era, content is king.

And distribution is queen.

For that, I would love to see where else you guys are pushing content.

In my case, it is Facebook organic and paid, whereas Instagram is more of a broader audience net.

Of course, all of that leading to a sales funnel we are still working on.

What about you guys?

"WHY IT’S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE MARKETING DURING A CRISIS. PART 2⚠️

If you’re an e-commerce business, NOW is the time you want to utilise Social Media Advertising to push online product sales. 📈

💻 Customer buying behaviour has dramatically shifted further in favour of buying online. 

📉 Physical storefront sales will continue to decline even after lockdown is lifted. 

💡 Many of your competitors are choosing to STOP their marketing budgets, meaning you can now generate a better ROI at a cheaper cost! (less players on the field!)

This month, one of our our e-commerce clients are seeing great ROI. They continue to invest during a period where the demand for e-commerce products are flying! 🚀
May’s Facebook Ads results from just one our campaigns so far:

✅ 104 purchases so far in May
✅ Total advertising spend = £298
✅ Total revenue GENERATED = £2057

If you have any questions about how your business can generate MORE e-commerce sales, then feel free to send me a direct message!📩

"Now is the time to use direct mail 🚀🚀🚀

Brands shouldn't just send something for the sake of sending it, but now is the time to talk to your customers through DM. 

Since working from home for the past 8 weeks I have received only transactional mail through my letterbox! Brands have a huge opportunity to speak directly to there customers away from all the noise!
