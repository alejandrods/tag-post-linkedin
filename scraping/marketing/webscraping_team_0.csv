"Yesterday we held our final HEC Data Minds assembly of the 2019-2020 year! It was a bittersweet moment to share with our members currently scattered across the globe. 

HEC Data Minds is a professional student club at HEC Paris dedicated to bringing data literacy and data science to our larger business school student community. 

As Head of Communications of our association, it has been an absolute honor and pleasure to work alongside my bright colleagues to foster the growth of HEC Data Minds - one of the most diverse clubs on campus with over 30 members across 19 different countries. 

This year we've held numerous events from conferences, workshops, and hackathons to social gatherings and company visits. 

I'd like to extend a massive thank you to the entire team for being involved and especially to my fellow board members 
Mikko, Nathan, Rebecca, Basit-us-Salam, Jan, Anthony
who truly showed that teamwork makes the dream work!

Lastly, feel free to check out our newly updated website for more information on future events and partnership opportunities: www.hecdataminds.com

Excited to see what the next year has in store for the new team!"
