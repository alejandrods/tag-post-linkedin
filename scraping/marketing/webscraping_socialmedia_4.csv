"I had a lovely virtual coffee date with Khatija Qureshi yesterday! It's always great catching up! 

We talked about digital marketing, pivoting in these times, how we're doing our best to keep in touch and making it a point to connect with our network on a regular basis. We talked about working from home and plans for the rest of the year. 

I am always in awe of her wisdom and generosity when it comes to helping others. If you are a newcomer to Canada and would like to learn more about how she can help, don't be shy to connect with her.

"WARNING: Rant Post.

Today, I spoke to a friend of mine about the new freelance social media manager they hired, as she needed my advice to see if the campaigns were sound.

I looked through the campaign and it didn‚Äôt seem like they considered or even knew the business goals.

I asked her to go back to the freelancer and ask some simple questions such as:

How does this content help towards X business goal?

Who is the audience for this post?

What do they hope to achieve?

To my surprise, when my friend asked the freelancer, she refused to answer and told her to find somebody else to do her work.

Our jobs as digital marketers is to help clients achieve business goals, it is not just to post on social media, it is not to get them ranking for keywords for the sake of it, it is not just to send emails to stay in contact.

We exist to ensure business survival, growth and manage the reputations of our clients.

We should care.

"Weekly Gen Z Wrap-Up

1. Debby Ryan memes are everything this week and I died when I saw her tweet (link in comments).

Pretty sure the real takeaway here is that there are some phenomenal actors on TikTok.

2. Outer Banks, a Netflix TV show about 400 million in gold hidden somewhere and it‚Äôs up to a bunch of 25-year-old looking 16-year-olds to go find it, has been trending.

Honestly one of the worst TV shows and you‚Äôre goddamn right I watched every episode. 

3. GAP released a new teen collection targeted at Gen Z that's made from 100% organically grown cotton.

This is a step in the right direction but I question whether they‚Äôre going far enough. Can they close the loop on their supply chain??? 

4. May the 4th was this week (Star Wars).

Some great order 66 memes. Would watch them again not on May 4th.

"Sometimes I choose a song for TikTok  because it‚Äôs trending even though I have no idea what it‚Äôs about. 

What I do know is that I can‚Äôt get this melody out of my head so my apologies in advance if the same goes for you.

I figured out a way to use my chainsaw to make projects to share on my various social media accounts, this is the first of two. It rained yesterday or I probably would‚Äôve kept going.

Let me know what you think of my first attempt at a dessert stand. I show three possible ways to style the log cookies.

"History determines our actions for tomorrow. Hence, I wrote my mind down about the evolution of one of the most lucrative fields of marketing - Brand Experience. Within this article, I discuss how the ""age of products"" is collaborating with experiential technologies to create the brands of tomorrow. Brands that believe in creating value by getting involved with their customers through personal experiences.

"Last month we began testing 'Group Membership' as a commercial opportunity within our portfolio of closed 'On a Budget' Facebook groups and it's proving to be a huge success. 
As you can see below, it allows brands to join in the conversation, building rapport, trust and ultimately point group members in the right direction in order to find their products.
This monthly subscription offer is currently available in our DIY (1.8M members) and Gardening (300K members) and is a unique opportunity to reach an otherwise unreachable community.

"How my friend lost RM400 to an impersonation account on Instagram!

A cyber thief created an Instagram account, pretending to be me by using a similar profile picture and the same account name with minor variance, which is hardly noticeable at a quick glance! If anyone accepts the fake account, it will initiate the attack by asking for your phone number. Unfortunately, one of my friends gave, the worst happened when she gave the 6 digits code received via SMS. Apparently, that code was to approve a transaction via GrabPay. All these happened within a couple of minutes.

I am sharing this, hoping to create cybersecurity awareness, so that we could have a safer cyberspace. Meanwhile, I hope all technology providers would look into this matter seriously, and take the necessary steps to minimize the occurrences. (Note: Multiple reports have been filed to Instagram, but no action is taken so far, it's so disappointing.)

Just like battling Covid19, we should be more alert and do our parts to protect ourselves from potential cyber-attacks.

"Are you guys really using the potential of all social media environments?

Gary V says you need to be everywhere...

However, you can only cover as much with your time.

But the truth is that, in the information era, content is king.

And distribution is queen.

For that, I would love to see where else you guys are pushing content.

In my case, it is Facebook organic and paid, whereas Instagram is more of a broader audience net.

Of course, all of that leading to a sales funnel we are still working on.

What about you guys?
