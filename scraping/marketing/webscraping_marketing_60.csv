"I've been asked a few times recently about recently about infographics and how they can be used to help tell a story. There are lots of ways this can be done, but coming from a video/animation perspective, then using them in an animated way to bring life to facts and figures makes perfect sense. In response to the question, I've put together this short video which demonstrates a few techniques at the same time as giving a positive message about the growing importance of video. Using, just two colours, a bit of research and some audio, this is just one version of what can be achieved. Mix this with actual video footage, a voiceover or just leave as stand alone, this could be right for your business.

"Want better lead management for your sales team? Think about how teams will work together.

As a lead management best practice, Sales and Marketing teams should be working toward a set of mutually agreed upon metrics. But all too often the two are using completely separate technologies with no visibility into one another‚Äôs data, resulting in a lack of transparency and closed loop reporting. 

No one ever really knows what‚Äôs working, and often, each blames the other without real evidence.

Instead, bring teams together to clarify goals and KPIs early and then decide on either a single platform (like HubSpot) or two platforms that integrate closely (like Salesforce and HubSpot, Pardot, or Marketo) and which can support both CRM and marketing automation functionalities.

"Agree. Looking back I formed Creative direction & Art direction for Lexus, Hyundai, designed brand identity for local brands, as well as grew brands international ecommerce and marketing performance by data and acquisition driven strategies.

I once got asked if we digital marketers can really handle both brand/ creatives and growth since they‚Äôre so opposite. My answer is YES. It‚Äôs not about how opposite they‚Äôre against each other. It‚Äôs more about how you balance both of them and connect each other and maximise the results you want to achieve."
"The Covid19 pandemic has proved to us without a doubt that we need to not just utilize but also maximize digital technology to be successful in this ever-changing world.

"WHY IT‚ÄôS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE MARKETING DURING A CRISIS. PART 2‚ö†Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre an e-commerce business, NOW is the time you want to utilise Social Media Advertising to push online product sales. üìà

üíª Customer buying behaviour has dramatically shifted further in favour of buying online. 

üìâ Physical storefront sales will continue to decline even after lockdown is lifted. 

üí° Many of your competitors are choosing to STOP their marketing budgets, meaning you can now generate a better ROI at a cheaper cost! (less players on the field!)

This month, one of our our e-commerce clients are seeing great ROI. They continue to invest during a period where the demand for e-commerce products are flying! üöÄ
May‚Äôs Facebook Ads results from just one our campaigns so far:

‚úÖ 104 purchases so far in May
‚úÖ Total advertising spend = ¬£298
‚úÖ Total revenue GENERATED = ¬£2057

If you have any questions about how your business can generate MORE e-commerce sales, then feel free to send me a direct message!üì©

"I recently got to spend a morning in conversation with the IAS' Johanna McDowell to discuss the challenges that creative agencies would likely face as they tackle a new world after lockdown.

As we all work to define a 'new normal' and get back to real-world face time with clients it is important to keep in mind the fundamentals of building great businesses.

So, whether event agency, PR agency, creative agency, or even as a marketing client, there are some real nuggets in this conversation to help us all do better business, together. (And some great insights that are actually applicable to all businesses...)

"The traditional financial advisor is not allowed to help you keep your money, that is, from taxes.  ‚ÄúWe can not give you tax advice,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúbecause we are not accountants.‚Äù 

(FOR THE RECORD You should always consult a licensed accountant before making any tax decisions.)

So let me get this straight.  Most financial experts agree that the biggest expense over our lifetime is taxes.  Warren Buffet teach that the first rule of wealth building is ‚Äòdon‚Äôt lose money.‚Äô  Even so, the traditional advisor then can not help you here???  So that means you are left with going to your accountants, many of whom are not paid to give advice but to file your paperwork.  I think this is nuts.  This is why it is maddening that so many people mindlessly turn over their money to the traditional financial advisors when in doing so they are losing out on strategies that will help them RETAIN more of their wealth.  Tell them to beat it.

"Finding and choosing to work with an agency for your business can feel daunting. 

Who do you trust? 

How do you know their strategy will work for your business? 

Is now the right time? 

What if you just don't like them? üò≥

We've found businesses have these doubts (plus more) when choosing a partner to help their business grow.

The right partner for you should be able to bring your concerns to light and work with you to address them. 

Keep in mind, successful agencies will be vetting you too. 

As an agency your success is our success. 

We want to enter into a partnership that is mutually beneficial. 

Here's a <2 min highlight from my conversation with Dan Ritzke of Third Act Marketing. We talk about how the right partner can make a business owner's life easier and how simple goals will lead to  success.

Yes, you heard that right;

Imagine a marketing platform where competition is close to NONE.

A platform full of those ""bottom of the funnel"" pre-qualified leads that are not only in the loop but also much more likely to buy.

It exists,

"If you're looking for a great Headline to use today (for copy, an email, or video)....try this one:

(I directly stole this from ""Breakthrough Advertising"" by Eugene Schwartz):

""Give Me One Evening and I'll Give You a Push-Button Memory"" - What a FANTASTIC line! 

Here's what makes it impactful:

1. It implies an immediate benefit: A better memory.
2. It's very specific on what you get: A ""push-button"" memory.
3. It shows the time-frame you can get results: In one evening. 
4. It's a clear trade: You give me THIS..... I give you THAT in return.
5. Kind of sums up the entire thing.... in one little sentence. 

So you can apply it to your own business in many ways:

1. ""Give me two hours, and I'll show you how to get 4 dates a week.""
2. ""Trade us one weekend, and we'll show you how to double your real estate leads.""
3. ""Trade me 47 bucks, and I'll show you how I made a digital product that sold 20,000 copies""
4. ""For the cost of a large pizza, I'll let give you a personal tour inside my $250,000/year internet business"" 
huh?  

You can experiment with this headline. But use it wisely, my friend :-)

"The cure for 
#writing anxiety?

In 2019, after a decade of grit, Michael Werwie finally made it as a screenwriter. His 13th script, a Ted Bundy biopic, premiered at Sundance. And then it headlined on Netflix.

He had found success! But his angst lingered:

‚ÄúEvery new project feels like it's the first time I've ever written,‚Äù said Werwie. ‚ÄúLike the last movie was just a fluke, and the imposter syndrome is real.‚Äù

Poignant reminder that even professional 
#writers feel anxious about their ability. 

Maybe you know the feeling? I know I do.

And the cure?

Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure one exists.

I think a degree of self-doubt is baked into the discipline. And all you can really do is learn to anticipate the angst, and embrace it when it comes, and convert that bad energy into good energy, creative energy, productive energy. 

‚ÄúOK but how, Eddie? Convert it how??‚Äù

Again, not sure.

That is, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a set playbook. We‚Äôre all different. And a big part of becoming a 
#writer is just doing it enough to find YOUR process. And the only way to find it is by showing up, by making writing a daily habit. THIS I‚Äôm sure of. 

Whether you do 
#screenwriting or 
#copywriting or anything else, walk the same steps each day and you‚Äôll eventually forge a path you can depend on.

Re-evaluate the underlying belief that drives your business; your brand purpose. Is it still relevant today? If not, how could you iterate on it or reframe it so that your purpose resonates with consumers now?

Re-imagine your product or service for new audiences and new needs. How can you deliver an experience that people want now? What new form could it take? Is there a new way you could deliver your product or service to your customers?

Create a whole new approach to pricing that removes barriers from trying your product or service. What low risk incentives could you offer?

Approach marketing from a completely different perspective. Could you use strategic partnerships? Mobilize passionate loyalists? Would a targeted, geographic focus make sense?

We talk about how

Other topics include my agency, ...Gasp!, our role in collaborating with and publishing Ryan Wallman's The Drum Roses Award winning book ""Delusions of Brandeur"", how Tim Williams is a genius when it comes to pricing creativity, why we should all fail a little more and <breathe> a bit more in between.

3. Show how to handle complex issues - there's a lot of new information these days. Break it down and make it easy to understand

"Do you ever find yourself reading your company's website and think, ""We just sound like everyone else. What's our voice?""

It may be helpful to look through your site and ask yourself few key questions:

‚ñ™Ô∏è Why are you doing content marketing?
‚ñ™Ô∏è How do you intend to improve SEO, increase site traffic and boost conversations?
‚ñ™Ô∏èWho is your target?
‚ñ™Ô∏èWhat can you do to uniquely support your target?

The words on your website are an extension of your brand. But if you're not there yet, don't beat yourself up.

"The cure for 
hashtag
#writing anxiety?

In 2019, after a decade of grit, Michael Werwie finally made it as a screenwriter. His 13th script, a Ted Bundy biopic, premiered at Sundance. And then it headlined on Netflix.

He had found success! But his angst lingered:

‚ÄúEvery new project feels like it's the first time I've ever written,‚Äù said Werwie. ‚ÄúLike the last movie was just a fluke, and the imposter syndrome is real.‚Äù

Poignant reminder that even professional 
hashtag
#writers feel anxious about their ability. 

Maybe you know the feeling? I know I do.

And the cure?

Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure one exists.

I think a degree of self-doubt is baked into the discipline. And all you can really do is learn to anticipate the angst, and embrace it when it comes, and convert that bad energy into good energy, creative energy, productive energy. 

‚ÄúOK but how, Eddie? Convert it how??‚Äù

Again, not sure.

That is, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a set playbook. We‚Äôre all different. And a big part of becoming a 
hashtag
#writer is just doing it enough to find YOUR process. And the only way to find it is by showing up, by making writing a daily habit. THIS I‚Äôm sure of. 

Whether you do 
hashtag
#screenwriting or 
hashtag
#copywriting or anything else, walk the same steps each day and you‚Äôll eventually forge a path you can depend on.

"Unlocking LinkedIn

I didnt know the power of linkedIn until i started using it for my own business  and closing high valued leads.

Its truly exceptional especially for B2B marketing.I am not even talking about running ads on LinkedIn; Personally I find them very expensive.I am talking about generating organic traffic , networking with your Target audience, sending them high valued solutions for their urgency  and then closing deals.

One of my client Nikhil Mansharamani,Owner ABC International   (recruitment agency) where he could covert clients from Romania  during Covid times.Well i dont wish to brag but its quite an achievement for us and  on Nikhil's part  to sell services with current mindset.

Pro tip : Work on your headline for LINKedIN

I  help (Target audience )get results___________  in time  frame___________ without _______________.

eg. I help entrepreneurs get 10x profit within 30 days without having huge marketing spends.

What's your headline ?

"No 'new normal'?

""Every big event shifts and shapes our behaviour. A ‚Äònew normal‚Äô however is one where the operating system itself undergoes a change ‚Äì like redefining the future of work or journalism or advertising or urban commutes and I somehow feel those notions are premature and overstated"": Karthik Nagarajan in ET Brand Equity today. 

In this exclusive piece for BE, Nagarajan, chief content officer, Wavemaker, wonders if there will be ""a new normal"" after the lockdown lifts. The answer, he believes, is 'No'.

"Are you guys really using the potential of all social media environments?

Gary V says you need to be everywhere...

However, you can only cover as much with your time.

But the truth is that, in the information era, content is king.

And distribution is queen.

For that, I would love to see where else you guys are pushing content.

In my case, it is Facebook organic and paid, whereas Instagram is more of a broader audience net.

Of course, all of that leading to a sales funnel we are still working on.

What about you guys?

As the government played a vital role in the economy, therefore it is crucial for central and each of the regional governments to understand and develop SPA (servicing/surviving, preparing, and actualizing) plans. For areas that have been infected by the COVID-19, the regional government should have a surviving plan, while areas that have not been infected can service and prepare.

Webinar overload is very real, but this ON24 article has it right. 

Our clients are still pulling in big numbers for their webinar attendance, but it's because you need to provide value - not just the same information as everyone else. 

1. Bring in experts
2. Provide CLE or CPE credit or CEUs
3. Show how to handle complex issues - there's a lot of new information these days. Break it down and make it easy to understand

If you're doing webinars or thinking about, worth a read.

"In my adjacent career as a sponsored competitive shooter I'm often asked by my consulting clients how they can get influencers to better represent their products in their ""influencer marketing"" campaigns. 

Well, influencer marketing is a media buy. Sometimes with money, sometimes with product, and sometimes with both. But just like in the golden age of TV, campaigns themselves start with the selection of the right media. 

Unlike TV shows though, influencers need to be believable, and the use of the products needs to be genuine. So product placement must contain three essential elements:

1) Utility: The product needs to be useful to the influencer whose audience you are attempting to reach. Otherwise, nobody is being influenced to buy anything.

2) Context: Content itself needs to be natural, and applied within the regular goings-on of the influencer's content. It cannot be forced. If the product doesn't fit the influencer's passion, it turns into a TV commercial, and all credibility goes out the window.

3) Consistency: In order to be believable, the product needs to be used over time by the influencer for the audience to trust that the product is also good enough for them. Otherwise, they are NOT going to bite.

"Unlocking LinkedIn

I didnt know the power of linkedIn until i started using it for my own business  and closing high valued leads.

Its truly exceptional especially for B2B marketing.I am not even talking about running ads on LinkedIn; Personally I find them very expensive.I am talking about generating organic traffic , networking with your Target audience, sending them high valued solutions for their urgency  and then closing deals.

One of my client Nikhil Mansharamani,Owner ABC International   (recruitment agency) where he could covert clients from Romania  during Covid times.Well i dont wish to brag but its quite an achievement for us and  on Nikhil's part  to sell services with current mindset.

Pro tip : Work on your headline for LINKedIN

I  help (Target audience )get results___________  in time  frame___________ without _______________.

eg. I help entrepreneurs get 10x profit within 30 days without having huge marketing spends.

What's your headline ?

"‚ÄúIt always seems impossible until it‚Äôs done.‚Äù - Nelson Mandela 

The past few years have been filled with achievements, challenges, and career/personal development. I received my second Master‚Äôs degree in Business Analytics, where I had the opportunity to gain skills and expertise with a more technical focus. 

My background in Marketing, International Business, and Business Analytics has driven me to find the story behind the data. I am capable of deriving strategies for communicating valuable information to consumers, while analyzing and interpreting the effectiveness of these interactions. 

I am thankful for the opportunities my Master's degrees in International Business and Business Analytics have brought. Looking forward to facing new challenges and achieving new goals in the future.

"Finding and choosing to work with an agency for your business can feel daunting. 

Who do you trust? 

How do you know their strategy will work for your business? 

Is now the right time? 

What if you just don't like them? üò≥

We've found businesses have these doubts (plus more) when choosing a partner to help their business grow.

The right partner for you should be able to bring your concerns to light and work with you to address them. 

Keep in mind, successful agencies will be vetting you too. 

As an agency your success is our success. 

We want to enter into a partnership that is mutually beneficial. 

Here's a <2 min highlight from my conversation with Dan Ritzke of Third Act Marketing. We talk about how the right partner can make a business owner's life easier and how simple goals will lead to  success.

"How to Convert More Customers from PPC Campaigns?

We all know that PPC is excellent for driving targeted traffic to your website, especially if it‚Äôs continuously optimized over time.

The battle for optimization, however, doesn‚Äôt end at driving traffic. Optimization must take place at another level ‚Äì and that is at the level of conversions.

No matter what your conversion goals are, from your potential customers signing up for a report or for your newsletter, signing up for a product demo, booking an appointment, down to making a purchase‚Ä¶ the path and its elements must be monitored and tweaked to maximize conversions.

There are many levels to optimizing PPC campaigns ‚Äî 

Conversion rate optimization technically starts at the landing page, given that the stages beforehand are properly optimized. That being said, it is essential to ensure that your campaign is improved at the ad level, which affects CTR, before making any effort to enhance your landing pages.

"IMO-2020 in Shipping Industry :- Scrubbers shall still pay off despite narrowing spread between VLSFO(<0.5%) & HSFO(<3.5%) 
Following opportunities can be exploited with details in this post,
‚óè There shall be increased demand for Scrubbers, as only 17% ships have been fitted with Scrubbers so far out of 60000 ships in the world.
‚óè Companies offering Scrubbers at a lower price shall have an edge as Shipowners are under tremendous pressure due to losses on account of Covid19. 
Please read on....
‚ñ™Ô∏éIn 2019 Industry planned for VLSFO use from Jan20 to meet emissions norms.
‚ñ™Ô∏éIt was expected that HSFO prices would fall & VLSFO prices will rise due to increased demand. Spread (PMT) between 2 fuels was projected  around 200$ in 20-21, 450$ in 21-22 & around 135 $ in 24-25 due to increased  demand of HSFO after retrofitting of Scrubbers on ships.
‚ñ™Ô∏éHowever due to COVID19, VLSFO demand is on decline whereas the demand of HSFO has been stable resulting in reduced spread of 95 $ in Mar20 against 300$ in Jan20.
‚ñ™Ô∏éDespite lower spread, the investment payback period for Scrubbers may be 6-18 months, depending on the cost of Scrubber & daily consumption of HSFO which results in substantial savings on Fuel costs.

"Industry Roundtable Roundups - Government Sector Perspective

As the government played a vital role in the economy, therefore it is crucial for central and each of the regional governments to understand and develop SPA (servicing/surviving, preparing, and actualizing) plans. For areas that have been infected by the COVID-19, the regional government should have a surviving plan, while areas that have not been infected can service and prepare.

"WHY IT‚ÄôS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE MARKETING DURING A CRISIS. PART 2‚ö†Ô∏è

If you‚Äôre an e-commerce business, NOW is the time you want to utilise Social Media Advertising to push online product sales. üìà

üíª Customer buying behaviour has dramatically shifted further in favour of buying online. 

üìâ Physical storefront sales will continue to decline even after lockdown is lifted. 

üí° Many of your competitors are choosing to STOP their marketing budgets, meaning you can now generate a better ROI at a cheaper cost! (less players on the field!)

This month, one of our our e-commerce clients are seeing great ROI. They continue to invest during a period where the demand for e-commerce products are flying! üöÄ
May‚Äôs Facebook Ads results from just one our campaigns so far:

‚úÖ 104 purchases so far in May
‚úÖ Total advertising spend = ¬£298
‚úÖ Total revenue GENERATED = ¬£2057

If you have any questions about how your business can generate MORE e-commerce sales, then feel free to send me a direct message!üì©

#marketing are wrongly used as interchangeable terms.

The brand is the substance while marketing is the form.

"I've been asked a few times recently about recently about infographics and how they can be used to help tell a story. There are lots of ways this can be done, but coming from a video/animation perspective, then using them in an animated way to bring life to facts and figures makes perfect sense. In response to the question, I've put together this short video which demonstrates a few techniques at the same time as giving a positive message about the growing importance of video. Using, just two colours, a bit of research and some audio, this is just one version of what can be achieved. Mix this with actual video footage, a voiceover or just leave as stand alone, this could be right for your business.

Learning doesn't stop and now's the perfect opportunity to start investing in myself. There are so many free online resources available to help you explore your interests, and you can also reach out to professionals in a field you're curious about to ask some questions. Utilize LinkedIn and go build some relationships with the people you want to work with eventually!

""Every big event shifts and shapes our behaviour.

Shifting the focus to the summer, I'd like to announce that I have officially accepted a summer internship with Warner Bros. Entertainment as a Consumer Products Marketing MBA Intern. As someone who grew up a fan of many of WB's diverse portfolio of brands, I'm extremely excited to see what this summer holds!

We talked about digital marketing, pivoting in these times, how we're doing our best to keep in touch and making it a point to connect with our network on a regular basis. We talked about working from home and plans for the rest of the year. 

I am always in awe of her wisdom and generosity when it comes to helping others. If you are a newcomer to Canada and would like to learn more about how she can help, don't be shy to connect with her.

"We‚Äôre all making the best of a bad situation, and that includes maintaining your brand‚Äôs online presence. Find out the five strategies to boost your social proof today.

1. Boost your own platform and ask people to be a part of it. Engage with other people to help you get there. 

2. Network via social media. Consider having a virtual coffee session with someone who is vying for your time. It can yield a return more significant than you‚Äôd expect.

3. Engage influencers with a Call-to-Action. Choose influencers who you know will want to engage with your content, and tag them on your posts or videos.

4. Tell engaging stories to your followers. Every story needs a human touch, and you might never  know who your content will reach to.

5. Offer perks in exchange for purchase testimonials. Buyer decisions are influenced by what they read from others. Offer an incentive for your buyers to leave a review.

"If you want to get buyers to lean in NOW you have to promise a compelling change‚Äîa Promised Land you help to create. 

There are 5 elements that will make your promised Land an imperative (with a case study from Drift) üëá

1. Thrive in the new world
2. Difficult to reach w/o your help
3. Defeats the villain you define
4. Facilitates self-actualization and belonging (people like me are transforming like this)
5. Not your platform, but what they GET thanks to the platform

When you define and own a promised land, you'll find that while you never completely escape a competitive set...

People will come to you asking for the result you promise.

They compare, but only out of obligation. 

We can break down Drift's Old Way vs New Way positioning as an example of a promised land done well.

Without them, you are LOSING deals. 

With them:

1. Close more deals
2. Connect with customers the way THEY want (in a way you CAN'T without them)
3. Overcome the villain of complex, form-driven marketing
4. Create better results which = invaluable contributor
5. Not about chat. About happier customers and more $

Your question: What promised land can you create that will make your market have to stop and ask: How do I get there?

Define it, own it, and see your results üöÄ

"Whether we realise it or not, the switch from individual to social decision making has always been happening. It's been happening to an extent that most brands need to align themselves to community generated content over user generated individual content. I am more susceptible to buying something that someone else has got rather than realising my need for something and getting it. Virtually everyone on the globe will be connected really soon, and this trend is likely to never stop growing!

"I AM SO EXCITED TO BE IN NEW YORK CITY AGAIN....oh wait. I will be in my home office.  But I am excited to be talking to my NYC friends!  DMCNY asked me to share the findings from our study on TEAM LEADERS WORKING FROM HOME, and the values they share. If you have team leaders reporting up to you, knowing their shared values means you know what they care about most, and how to support them best during this enormous experiment in remote work culture! We found out some really insightful and actionable things, and I hope they help."

"Where does planning stop and action start?

It's so easy for us to plan something forever. But it won't ever turn into anything until you act.  

So, when should you stop planning, learning, and preparing?  My answer: At the point of diminishing returns

Everything in life has a point of diminishing returns.  This is the point in your activity where the time you're spending yields fewer and fewer results.  So when you have to work harder to reach that next level, sometimes, it's time to act.

I've had so many clients whose only realy problem was that they needed to get out of their own way.

What's really stopping you?  It isn't preparedness.  It's fear of failure.  

Well, news flash: you WILL fail.  It's part of the process.  Better to fail fast than slow.

So if you're at a point where you're trying to decide whether it's time to take action, it probably is.

"You have only 8 seconds to read this

What if I told you that you are likely to lose attention from this post within the next 8 seconds. My time is up, but looks like I still have your attention so lest keep going. Its is interesting to know that the average attention span of people is 8 seconds, this means that in communicating with your customers you have only 8 seconds to catch their attention. 

You must be thinking how on earth is this possible but the truth is for some category of customers it takes less than 8 seconds to catch their attention. Customers are busy people who barely have time to spare in this age of technology and information. The ubiquitous spread of information across the media makes it very difficult to catch the full attention of customers. A text message notification from your partner recieved now can take your attention away from this post. So you see how easily it is for customers to be distracted and lose attention from your content. 

To create content that can beat the 8 seconds rule you must first of all research your target audience to know who they are, their needs, their interest, what drives their passion, their ambitions, what excites them etc.
Next you have to create a theme for your content.... (continued in next post)

Pretty late to it, but Moz is free for the next 15 days till 31st May for SEO 101. 

Moz has always been my number one introduction when it comes to people understanding what it is about. It has great visuals, outstanding summary, and easy-to-grasp examples. Pity on the keyword, ""SEO"" they always rank right below Neil Patel on the SERP.

#hottake on Star Wars Marketing üî•Baby Yoda was the biggest marketing fail of 2019. Here's why:


üëâThe Mandalorian was released on November 12, 2019 üöÄ

üëâThe Child, aka Baby Yoda, became an online sensation within HOURS of the show's launch üí•

üëâNo official merchandise was available for US Black Friday (November 27)

üëâNo official merchandise ready for peak holiday shopping dates in the US (December 1-15, Deloitte, graph included in comment) 
üí•Search rates for Baby Yoda PEAKED during this window! (see Google Trends picture)

Where did consumers go instead?

üëâEtsy, Redbubble, Amazon, Society6...

üò±Hasbro is only launching an official line of Baby Yoda merch THIS MONTH (May 2020) DisneyStore had a Baby Yoda product line available at the beginning of 2020. 

I'm still wondering why Disney, the experts on character launches (look at Frozen 2's ‚ùÖ launch + new character look turnover) wasn't ready with products to support a character DESIGNED and WRITTEN for audiences to love ü§î
