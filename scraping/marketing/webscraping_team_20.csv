"How do you create sales team performance? 

Leading Teams are pioneers in the area of 'high performance' and have been for more the 27 years.

In this 2nd interview, I'm privileged to chat with Mr Daniel Healy (Partner/Director at Leading Teams) about the Leading Teams model for creating high performing teams. 

My key takeaway from Interview#2 - Create a COMMON PURPOSE, and then build out an 'Agreed Behavioural Framework' - this is the only way to create high performance. Most sales departments only ever attain ARTIFICIAL HARMONY if they are lucky. 

Check out the video and let Daniel and myself know your thoughts/feedback.

Interview #3 will explore the Leading Teams relationship model in more detail. Stay tuned.

"I had the honour of joining Dr Calic and his team in Norway last year.  I was moved by such an incredibly friendly, caring and inspiring team with a total focus on improving their patients quality of life. The PCI center at Sørlandet Hospital in Arendal, Norway, led by Dr. Calic, was the world’s first site to perform IVUS and iFR/FFR using an integrated Philips Cath lab ecosystem that includes Azurion, IntraSight, and SyncVision.  Read Dr Slobodan Calic's customer story now and see how partnering with Philips has increased the efficiency of their cath lab whilst maintaining an exceptional quality of care.

"Another bona fide star 💫 

Anna Louit has not only been an incredible colleague but an amazing friend since I met her a year ago. 

ONQOR Group would genuinely not be the same company without her. Her drive, ambition, creativity & passion are felt by all those she encounters.

A force to be reckoned with, & irrefutably one of the most talented people I have had the pleasure of meeting, she has an enviably bright future ahead of her.

To many more years as friends and colleagues 🥂 

Joyeux Anniversaire!

"Yesterday we held our final HEC Data Minds assembly of the 2019-2020 year! It was a bittersweet moment to share with our members currently scattered across the globe. 

HEC Data Minds is a professional student club at HEC Paris dedicated to bringing data literacy and data science to our larger business school student community. 

As Head of Communications of our association, it has been an absolute honor and pleasure to work alongside my bright colleagues to foster the growth of HEC Data Minds - one of the most diverse clubs on campus with over 30 members across 19 different countries. 

This year we've held numerous events from conferences, workshops, and hackathons to social gatherings and company visits. 

I'd like to extend a massive thank you to the entire team for being involved and especially to my fellow board members 
Mikko, Nathan, Rebecca, Basit-us-Salam, Jan, Anthony
who truly showed that teamwork makes the dream work!

Lastly, feel free to check out our newly updated website for more information on future events and partnership opportunities: www.hecdataminds.com

Excited to see what the next year has in store for the new team!"

"Sneak preview: 
Stepping away from Finance and into my 'labor of love' is a continuous journey. I am in absolute awe about the abundance, the trust of our clients, and quite simply the joy every step brings on this path. It is not an understatement when I say that I was taken by absolute surprise by the wave of clients and assignments since launching the firm. 

So much so, that I paid little attention to building a website and any virtual presence. I am sorry to say, I also treated LinkedIn a bit like a stepchild. 
In the spirit of not going it alone, we recently built a world-class team with Daniela Luschin-Wangail and other passionate experts. And so, finally! we have the capacity to create our vision of MagnoliaTree -in the WWW and in the real world. Inspired by my friend Elisabeth Motsch I also found my way back to LinkedIn. So here it is, the first teaser preview of our website creation. I can promise you this, it will be extraordinary and round with a bit edginess. Just like we are at MagnoliaTree.

"Do you like strawberries?

Max my dog loves it and he expresses it clearly.

From our first words we learn the notion of yes and no
Later in adolescence the no vote takes over the yes vote. 
The professional environment makes us aware of the need for compromise.

Basically do we not lose the real impact of yes or no ...?

Whether we agree or disagree the real issue is why and to argue objectively and by proposing alternatives where appropriate.

With my own crazy life juggling work, 3 children and community action, I don’t get the chance to thank them enough for all they are doing to keep projects going in spite of some of the new challenges. 

I suspect we’ve got tougher times to come later this year, so it’s hugely reassuring to know how skilled and dedicated our APECians are. 

Good luck to our 2 assistants today!"

"The Coronavirus is accelerating one of the biggest 
hashtag
#business transformations in decades. While the dramatic spread of COVID-19 has disrupted lives, livelihoods, communities & businesses worldwide, the pandemic also become an opportunity for companies to create even more value & positive societal impact, rather than just bounce back to the status quo. 

These are challenging times for everyone but also a time few are bound to forget very quickly. While no one likes adversity, it often reveals true character. The more thoughtful companies are about how they support their employees, the better chance they have to build resiliency within their staff, safeguard their organisational culture and for their brand’s impression on their customers.

After textile giant Trident Group decided to increase the wage of its 12,000 workers recently, Asian Paints became another prominent name to swim against the tide in an effort to boost staff morale. 

The context of engagement, keeping employees motivated & the overall employee experience has changed dramatically over the last couple of weeks, but the opportunity & importance remain. There can’t be a better time for organisations & brands to SEIZE THE MOMENT.

"Meet Margriet Hooghiemstra, Strategy Program Director for DSM Additive Manufacturing: “I thrive on making strategic plans in fast growing businesses, helping organizations to reach success, and that’s what I’m proud to bring to DSM Additive Manufacturing. 

I joined the team in February and so far it has been a blast! I’m impressed by the number of different applications possible and I’m especially impressed by the passion my colleagues have when it comes to developing solutions for all those applications. It’s amazing to see how 3D printing can completely change the way we think about manufacturing. We currently see plenty of inspiring examples, where 3D printing can provide a very quick and flexible supply of any type of medical equipment needed for COVID-19 relief, at any location. 

Furthermore, I’m excited to see how additive manufacturing can contribute to a more sustainable way of production in the future.”

"How I hacked my Fridays.

Or how to finish week on a high note.

I usually felt stuck on Fridays.

Until I decided to complete my week with doing what I truly, deeply enjoy.

I shifted all my 1:1s with my team to Fridays.

This became one of the most powerful ways to end the week.

It pushed me to reflect, wear a listener hat and find ways how can I serve my team more and better.

I simply love it!

Throughout the week, we've held a number of webinars, talks and virtual activities for staff to educate and inform.

We've also produced case studies on the successes of our Women's first team, our quest to bolster our team of Dementia Friends to 500 staff members and delved into the role of our Female Inclusion officer and first team player Shannon Sievwright.

We're delighted with how well the week has gone, and would like to thank the charities and organisations that gave up their time to get involved and make the week so successful.

"In the Fall of 2016, I attended a SHPE-UIC meeting not realizing that this organization would have made my collegiate experience so complete. The chapter provided me with the tools and opportunities to develop as a young professional. Along the way, I met advisors, mentors and friends who empowered me to thrive in the engineering field. 

It has been an absolute pleasure and honor to have served as the SHPE-UIC President for the 2019-2020 academic year. Yet, the greatest honor was having worked with such an amazing and talented team. It was because of them that I learned how to become a better leader, and it was together that we accomplished great things. While this semester ends rather unconventionally, I would like to recognize the efforts of my team, the chapter, and the organization. Thank you for a wonderful four years, my SHPE-Familia!

"Are you creating a solutions based culture by letting your staff to come up with their own solutions and ideas?

We’ve implemented an initiative called the idea flash recently where anyone in the business (no matter their position) can submit an idea - if we like the idea, the team member who submitted it gets to champion the idea 👏

It’s been working really well so I’m keen to keep trying it out. Highly recommend this one! 

Do you have your own initiatives? Let me know 🔥

"Thanks Dawid Konotey-Ahulu for sharing your journey and key points with us. I have read ""Who moved my cheese"" but hearing the questions from you made me reflect. What would I do if I wasn't afraid? I would do a lot of things but I'm starting with this post.

Thank you Dennis Owusu-Sem Success Talks making this event happen and bringing together amazing speakers (Teresa Owusu-Adjei Ayesha Bedwei Keith Bevans Jacqui Harper  AUTHOR) for 3 full days, without charging a dime. The sessions were not only insightful, they were also inspiring and challenging.

"Building a startup team!

A startup has its origin in an idea.

The execution of idea brings the idea to life and gives its wings to fly high. 

The most important aspect of a startup is its team.

The growth & existence of a startup largely depends on the quality of its team. 

The important aspects of team are:

1. The belief system:

— The Founders & Co-Founders orginate the idea & bring belief to its possibilities of existence

— Their value & belief system sets the tone for organisational culture, mission & vision. 

2. The expertise:

— The initial team members are the foundational blocks of the organisation.

— Along with core expertise, they need to have degree of soft skills and ability to handle intense pressure.

— Attitudinal aspect becomes the key factor in on-boarding such team members when all other things are equal. 

3. The blend:

—Though the team members will have pre-determined roles and responsibilities to perform, multi-skilled members will go a long way.

— Understand the strengths of your team members, and involve them in those processes.

What other aspects are important in a team?

"Most conversations I have now naturally steer back to the discussion around ‘how the working environment will change after this’.
Its unsurprisingly a hot topic within my specialisms (FM/Property), with questions being raised around future requirements, but although there are challenges I also see many positives coming off the back of it.

Some of the positives I've witnessed in the working environment are great:

·      We are closer than ever.... I know the individuals within my direct team and in my client's teams better than I have ever done before (and arguably better than I would have without the pandemic).
·      Businesses are seeing an increase in productivity/output..... A client told me earlier this week that his procurement team have increased their output by circa 12%, and I know that my direct team's productivity has increased also.

Have others witnessed positives like this amidst all the challenges?

"Do you want to go back?

With Covid-19 restrictions easing, getting back to work is on the agenda.

I’m looking forward to getting back with our SeeChange team.  I’ve missed the ease of working together, the close support and the fun. 

Tracy the leader says it’s time to go back.
 
…….. but I don’t think I want to go back. 

Tracy the person would like to stay working from home.
I love working from home. 

The pace is slower. I have a better routine, I’m productive and getting results.

Sitting on my deck this morning, drinking my coffee and enjoying the sunshine, I had a realisation. 

Our team have all experienced lock down very differently. For some it can’t end soon enough, it’s been hard and they’re dying to get back to the office! 

And others, like me, aren’t so keen.

So what do we do?

How do I engage all of us in the next stage of change we are all facing?

Are you struggling with this too?

"Today I'm thinking about the importance of support, tautoko, awhi and aroha to folks. The community connections we share, and that have been missed by so many of us in the last couple of months are part of what feeds our energy, but also what feeds people's opportunities.
I'm reminded of this today as I am incredibly touched to receive a gorgeous liquid gift from a dear friend and talented career coach, Leanne McLean. Having Leanne around is like having your very own cheerleader. She's always in your corner, asking great questions and she's got an amazing skill in helping people understand their own value - as a human as well as in the job market. She also happens to have married a fabulous bloke who sell champagne, so I am grateful for her taste in men today too!
As we rebuild, re-frame and refit ourselves, it's vital that we offer bouquets - to the people that support us, recognise us, and sustain us. These ""bouquets"" can be invitations to the meeting, introductions, support for ideas, offering your connections - all mana-enhancing actions. 
They  offer both hope and optimism, and are incredibly important in leadership where the main job is to welcome others into the light.

"As the “new normal” starts to take shape across many countries around the globe, are you planning to continue to work at home or head to the office?

Is your business, it’s processes and infrastructure in a good shape to allow your team to work safely and effectively, from either the office and remotely?

In Australia, as the country starts to engage the economy after weeks of isolation measures I’m excited at the prospect of soon returning to the office and seeing some of the 42 Interactive team members and our amazing partners in the flesh.
This will not only help the sanity levels but will assist in creating some more digital technology magic with our design and development wizards.

"This week was a particularly tough one,  especially after the highs of last week. I have been reflecting on what keeps me in there, what I am leaning into and letting go of and I have to say there are 3 things; 1. Back myself- because others have and do and will have my back - I just need to bring me  2. Our mahi is kaupapa driven,  it's not about me so just get on with it and 3. Be ready to pivot!
These 3 things may seem incongruous but they are actually complimentary. I just need to do what I do well in the team to get the job done! Lean into what I do well, let go of getting it right all the time and be agile.

"As a leader, one of your most critical responsibilities is turning your team into what can be considered a high-performing team. And to do that there are seven elements that you need to bring together to turn your team into one that just exists into one that's considered really high-performing.
First, you have to set direction. You have to lay out a vision for what that organization's going to be three to five years from now. What type of resources do you need and why do you need them? And then you have to make a clear and compelling business case to get those resources allocated to you and your team. And once you've assembled them, you have to think through as a leader how are you going to build chemistry between those individuals? And then lastly, prioritize your efforts so you focus on the most important things and execute them well. Once you have those priorities set, you have to execute the plan, which includes making decisions. 
Next, you have to think through your people and how are you going to motivate them. Enable them to make decisions. Then providing feedback to them on their performance and resolve any conflict that may exist between them. Lastly, you need to take a longer-term view of developing your people. How are you going to build their skills?
